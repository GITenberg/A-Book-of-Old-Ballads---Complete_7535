<h3>Beverley Nichols</h3>

<p>These poems are the very essence of the British spirit. They
are, to<br>
literature, what the bloom of the heather is to the Scot, and
the<br>
smell of the sea to the Englishman. All that is beautiful in the
old<br>
word "patriotism" ... a word which, of late, has been twisted to
such<br>
ignoble purposes ... is latent in these gay and full-blooded
measures.</p>

<p>But it is not only for these reasons that they are so valuable
to the<br>
modern spirit. It is rather for their tonic qualities that they
should<br>
be prescribed in 1934. The post-war vintage of poetry is the
thinnest<br>
and the most watery that England has ever produced. But here, in
these<br>
ballads, are great draughts of poetry which have lost none of
their<br>
sparkle and none of their bouquet.</p>

<p>It is worth while asking ourselves why this should be--why
these poems<br>
should "keep", apparently for ever, when the average modern poem
turns<br>
sour overnight. And though all generalizations are dangerous I
believe<br>
there is one which explains our problem, a very simple one....
namely,<br>
that the eyes of the old ballad-singers were turned outwards,
while the<br>
eyes of the modern lyric-writer are turned inwards.</p>

<p>The authors of the old ballads wrote when the world was young,
and<br>
infinitely exciting, when nobody knew what mystery might not lie
on the<br>
other side of the hill, when the moon was a golden lamp, lit by
a<br>
personal God, when giants and monsters stalked, without the
slightest<br>
doubt, in the valleys over the river. In such a world, what could
a man<br>
do but stare about him, with bright eyes, searching the horizon,
while<br>
his heart beat fast in the rhythm of a song?</p>

<p>But now--the mysteries have gone. We know, all too well, what
lies on<br>
the other side of the hill. The scientists have long ago puffed
out,<br>
scornfully, the golden lamp of the night ... leaving us in the
uttermost<br>
darkness. The giants and the monsters have either skulked away or
have<br>
been tamed, and are engaged in writing their memoirs for the
popular<br>
press. And so, in a world where everything is known (and
nothing<br>
understood), the modern lyric-writer wearily averts his eyes, and
stares<br>
into his own heart.</p>

<p>That way madness lies. All madmen are ferocious egotists, and
so are all<br>
modern lyric-writers. That is the first and most vital
difference<br>
between these ballads and their modern counterparts. The old<br>
ballad-singers hardly ever used the first person singular. The
modern<br>
lyric-writer hardly ever uses anything else.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>II</h3>

<p>This is really such an important point that it is worth
labouring.</p>

<p>Why is ballad-making a lost art? That it <i>is</i> a lost art
there can<br>
be no question. Nobody who is painfully acquainted with the
rambling,<br>
egotistical pieces of dreary versification, passing for
modern<br>
"ballads", will deny it.</p>

<p>Ballad-making is a lost art for a very simple reason. Which
is, that we<br>
are all, nowadays, too sicklied o'er with the pale cast of
thought to<br>
receive emotions directly, without self-consciousness. If we
are<br>
wounded, we are no longer able to sing a song about a clean
sword, and a<br>
great cause, and a black enemy, and a waving flag. No--we must
needs go<br>
into long descriptions of our pain, and abstruse calculations
about its<br>
effect upon our souls.</p>

<p>It is not "we" who have changed. It is life that has changed.
"We" are<br>
still men, with the same legs, arms and eyes as our ancestors.
But life<br>
has so twisted things that there are no longer any clean swords
nor<br>
great causes, nor black enemies. And the flags do not know which
way to<br>
flutter, so contrary are the winds of the modern world. All is
doubt.<br>
And doubt's colour is grey.</p>

<p>Grey is no colour for a ballad. Ballads are woven from stuff
of<br>
primitive hue ... the red blood gushing, the gold sun shining,
the green<br>
grass growing, the white snow falling. Never will you find grey
in a<br>
ballad. You will find the black of the night and the raven's
wing,<br>
and the silver of a thousand stars. You will find the blue of
many<br>
summer skies. But you will not find grey.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>III</h3>

<p>That is why ballad-making is a lost art. Or almost a lost art.
For even<br>
in this odd and musty world of phantoms which we call the
twentieth<br>
century, there are times when a man finds himself in a certain
place at<br>
a certain hour and something happens to him which takes him out
of<br>
himself. And a song is born, simply and sweetly, a song which
other<br>
men can sing, for all time, and forget themselves.</p>

<p>Such a song was once written by a master at my old school,
Marlborough.<br>
He was a Scot. But he loved Marlborough with the sort of love
which the<br>
old ballad-mongers must have had-the sort of love which takes a
man on<br>
wings, far from his foolish little body.</p>

<p>He wrote a song called "The Scotch Marlburian".</p>

<p>Here it is:--</p>

<p>  Oh Marlborough, she's a toun o' touns<br>
  We will say that and mair,<br>
  We that ha' walked alang her douns<br>
  And snuffed her Wiltshire air.<br>
  A weary way ye'll hae to tramp<br>
  Afore ye match the green<br>
  O' Savernake and Barbery Camp<br>
  And a' that lies atween!</p>

<p>The infinite beauty of that phrase ... "and a' that lies
atween"! The<br>
infinite beauty as it is roared by seven hundred young throats
in<br>
unison! For in that phrase there drifts a whole pageant of
boyhood--the<br>
sound of cheers as a race is run on a stormy day in March, the
tolling<br>
of the Chapel bell, the crack of ball against bat, the sighs of
sleep<br>
in a long white dormitory.</p>

<p>But you may say "What is all this to me? I wasn't at
Maryborough. I<br>
don't like schoolboys ... they strike me as dirty, noisy, and
usually<br>
foul-minded. Why should I go into raptures about such a song,
which<br>
seems only to express a highly debatable approval of a certain
method of<br>
education?"</p>

<p>If you are asking yourself that sort of question, you are
obviously in<br>
very grave need of the tonic properties of this book. For after
you have<br>
read it, you will wonder why you ever asked it.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>IV</h3>

<p>I go back and back to the same point, at the risk of boring
you to<br>
distraction. For it is a point which has much more "to" it than
the<br>
average modern will care to admit, unless he is forced to do
so.</p>

<p>You remember the generalization about the eyes ... how they
used to look<br>
<i>out</i>, but now look <i>in</i>? Well, listen to this....</p>

<p>  <i>I'm</i> feeling blue,<br>
  <i>I</i> don't know what to do,<br>
  'Cos <i>I</i> love you<br>
  And you don't love <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>The above masterpiece is, as far as I am aware, imaginary. But
it<br>
represents a sort of <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of thousands of
lyrics<br>
which have been echoing over the post-war world. Nearly all these
lyrics<br>
are melancholy, with the profound and primitive melancholy of the
negro<br>
swamp, and they are all violently egotistical.</p>

<p>Now this, in the long run, is an influence of far greater evil
than one<br>
would be inclined at first to admit. If countless young men,
every<br>
night, are to clasp countless young women to their bosoms, and
rotate<br>
over countless dancing-floors, muttering "I'm feeling blue ...
<i>I</i><br>
don't know what to do", it is not unreasonable to suppose that
they will<br>
subconsciously apply some of the lyric's mournful egotism to
themselves.</p>

<p>Anybody who has even a nodding acquaintance with modern
psychological<br>
science will be aware of the significance of "conditioning", as
applied<br>
to the human temperament. The late M. Cou&eacute; "conditioned"
people into<br>
happiness by making them repeat, over and over again, the phrase
"Every<br>
day in every way I grow better and better and better."</p>

<p>The modern lyric-monger exactly reverses M. Cou&eacute;'s
doctrine. He makes<br>
the patient repeat "Every night, with all my might, I grow worse
and<br>
worse and worse." Of course the "I" of the lyric-writer is an
imaginary<br>
"I", but if any man sings "<i>I'm</i> feeling blue", often
enough, to a<br>
catchy tune, he will be a superman if he does not eventually
apply that<br>
"I" to himself.</p>

<p>But the "blueness" is really beside the point. It is the
<i>egotism</i><br>
of the modern ballad which is the trouble. Even when, as they<br>
occasionally do, the modern lyric-writers discover, to their<br>
astonishment, that they are feeling happy, they make the
happiness such<br>
a personal issue that half its tonic value is destroyed. It is
not, like<br>
the old ballads, just an outburst of delight, a sudden rapture at
the<br>
warmth of the sun, or the song of the birds, or the glint of
moonlight<br>
on a sword, or the dew in a woman's eyes. It is not an emotion so
sweet<br>
and soaring that self is left behind, like a dull chrysalis,
while the<br>
butterfly of the spirit flutters free. No ... the chrysalis is
never<br>
left behind, the "I", "I", "I", continues, in a maddening
monotone. And<br>
we get this sort of thing....</p>

<p>  <i>I</i> want to be happy,<br>
  But <i>I</i> can't be happy<br>
  Till <i>I've</i> made you happy too.</p>

<p>And that, if you please, is one of the jolliest lyrics of the
last<br>
decade! That was a song which made us all smile and set all our
feet<br>
dancing!</p>

<p>Even when their tale was woven out of the stuff of tragedy,
the old<br>
ballads were not tarnished with such morbid speculations. Read
the tale<br>
of the beggar's daughter of Bethnal Green. One shudders to think
what a<br>
modern lyric-writer would make of it. We should all be in tears
before<br>
the end of the first chorus.</p>

<p>But here, a lovely girl leaves her blind father to search for
fortune.<br>
She has many adventures, and in the end, she marries a knight.
The<br>
ballad ends with words of almost childish simplicity, but they
are words<br>
which ring with the true tone of happiness:--</p>

<p>  Thus was the feast ended with joye and delighte<br>
  A bridegroome most happy then was the young knighte<br>
  In joy and felicitie long lived hee<br>
  All with his faire ladye, the pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>I said that the words were of almost childish simplicity. But
the<br>
student of language, and the would-be writer, might do worse than
study<br>
those words, if only to see how the cumulative effect of
brightness and<br>
radiance is gained. You may think the words are artless, but
just<br>
ponder, for a moment, the number of brilliant verbal symbols
which are<br>
collected into that tiny verse. There are only four lines. But
those<br>
lines contain these words ...</p>

<p>Feast, joy, delight, bridegroom, happy, joy, young, felicity,
fair,<br>
pretty.</p>

<p>Is that quite so artless, after all? Is it not rather like an
old and<br>
primitive plaque, where colour is piled on colour till you would
say<br>
the very wood will burst into flame ... and yet, the total effect
is one<br>
of happy simplicity?</p>
<br><br>
<h3>V</h3>

<p>How were the early ballads born? Who made them? One man or
many? Were<br>
they written down, when they were still young, or was it only
after the<br>
lapse of many generations, when their rhymes had been sharpened
and<br>
their metres polished by constant repetition, that they were
finally<br>
copied out?</p>

<p>To answer these questions would be one of the most fascinating
tasks<br>
which the detective in letters could set himself. Grimm,
listening<br>
in his fairyland, heard some of the earliest ballads, loved
them,<br>
pondered on them, and suddenly startled the world by announcing
that<br>
most ballads were not the work of a single author, but of the
people at<br>
large. <i>Das Volk dichtet</i>, he said. And that phrase got him
into a<br>
lot of trouble. People told him to get back to his fairyland and
not<br>
make such ridiculous suggestions. For how, they asked, could a
whole<br>
people make a poem? You might as well tell a thousand men to make
a<br>
tune, limiting each of them to one note!</p>

<p>To invest Grimm's words with such an intention is quite
unfair.<br>
[Footnote:  For a discussion of Grimm's theories, together with
much<br>
interesting speculation on the origin of the ballads, the reader
should<br>
study the admirable introduction to <i>English and Scottish
Popular<br>
Ballads</i>, published by George Harrap &amp; Co., Ltd.]
Obviously a<br>
multitude of people could not, deliberately, make a single poem
any more<br>
than a multitude of people could, deliberately, make a single
picture,<br>
one man doing the nose, one man an eye and so on. Such a
suggestion is<br>
grotesque, and Grimm never meant it. If I might guess at what he
meant,<br>
I would suggest that he was thinking that the origin of ballads
must<br>
have been similar to the origin of the dance, (which was probably
the<br>
earliest form of aesthetic expression known to man).</p>

<p>The dance was invented because it provided a means of
prolonging ecstasy<br>
by art. It may have been an ecstasy of sex or an ecstasy of
victory ...<br>
that doesn't matter. The point is that it gave to a group of
people an<br>
ordered means of expressing their delight instead of just leaping
about<br>
and making loud cries, like the animals. And you may be sure that
as the<br>
primitive dance began, there was always some member of the tribe
a<br>
little more agile than the rest--some man who kicked a little
higher or<br>
wriggled his body in an amusing way. And the rest of them copied
him,<br>
and incorporated his step into their own.</p>

<p>Apply this analogy to the origin of ballads. It fits
perfectly.</p>

<p>There has been a successful raid, or a wedding, or some great
deed of<br>
daring, or some other phenomenal thing, natural or supernatural.
And now<br>
that this day, which will ever linger in their memories, is
drawing to<br>
its close, the members of the tribe draw round the fire and begin
to<br>
make merry. The wine passes ... and tongues are loosened. And
someone<br>
says a phrase which has rhythm and a sparkle to it, and the
phrase is<br>
caught up and goes round the fire, and is repeated from mouth to
mouth.<br>
And then the local wit caps it with another phrase and a rhyme is
born.<br>
For there is always a local wit in every community, however
primitive.<br>
There is even a local wit in the monkey house at the zoo.</p>

<p>And once you have that single rhyme and that little piece of
rhythm, you<br>
have the genesis of the whole thing. It may not be worked out
that<br>
night, nor even by the men who first made it. The fire may long
have<br>
died before the ballad is completed, and tall trees may stand
over the<br>
men and women who were the first to tell the tale. But rhyme and
rhythm<br>
are indestructible, if they are based on reality. "Not marble nor
the<br>
gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful
rhyme."</p>

<p>And so it is that some of the loveliest poems in the language
will ever<br>
remain anonymous. Needless to say, <i>all</i> the poems are
not<br>
anonymous. As society became more civilized it was inevitable
that the<br>
peculiar circumstances from which the earlier ballads sprang
should<br>
become less frequent. Nevertheless, about nearly all of the
ballads<br>
there is "a common touch", as though even the most self-conscious
author<br>
had drunk deep of the well of tradition, that sparkling well in
which so<br>
much beauty is distilled.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>But though the author or authors of most of the ballads may be
lost in<br>
the lists of time, we know a good deal about the minstrels who
sang<br>
them. And it is a happy thought that those minstrels were
such<br>
considerable persons, so honourably treated, so generously
esteemed.<br>
The modern mind, accustomed to think of the singer of popular
songs<br>
either as a highly paid music-hall artist, at the top of the
ladder, or<br>
a shivering street-singer, at the bottom of it, may find it
difficult to<br>
conceive of a minstrel as a sort of ambassador of song, moving
from<br>
court to court with dignity and ceremony.</p>

<p>Yet this was actually the case. In the ballad of King Estmere,
for<br>
example, we see the minstrel finely mounted, and accompanied by
a<br>
harpist, who sings his songs for him. This minstrel, too, moves
among<br>
kings without any ceremony. As Percy has pointed out, "The
further we<br>
carry our enquiries back, the greater respect we find paid to
the<br>
professors of poetry and music among all the Celtic and Gothic
nations.<br>
Their character was deemed so sacred that under its sanction our
famous<br>
King Alfred made no scruple to enter the Danish camp, and was at
once<br>
admitted to the king's headquarters."</p>

<p><i>And even so late as the time of Froissart, we have
minstrels and<br>
heralds mentioned together, as those who might securely go into
an<br>
enemy's country.</i></p>

<p>The reader will perhaps forgive me if I harp back, once more,
to our<br>
present day and age, in view of the quite astonishing change in
national<br>
psychology which that revelation implies. Minstrels and heralds
were<br>
once allowed safe conduct into the enemy's country, in time of
war. Yet,<br>
in the last war, it was considered right and proper to hiss the
work of<br>
Beethoven off the stage, and responsible newspapers seriously
suggested<br>
that never again should a note of German music, of however
great<br>
antiquity, be heard in England! We are supposed to have
progressed<br>
towards internationalism, nowadays. Whereas, in reality, we have
grown<br>
more and more frenziedly national. We are very far behind the age
of<br>
Froissart, when there was a true internationalism--the
internationalism<br>
of art.</p>

<p>To some of us that is still a very real internationalism. When
we hear a<br>
Beethoven sonata we do not think of it as issuing from the brain
of a<br>
"Teuton" but as blowing from the eternal heights of music whose
winds<br>
list nothing of frontiers.</p>

<p>Man <i>needs</i> song, for he is a singing animal. Moreover,
he needs<br>
communal song, for he is a social animal. The military
authorities<br>
realized this very cleverly, and they encouraged the troops,
during the<br>
war, to sing on every possible occasion. Crazy pacifists, like
myself,<br>
may find it almost unbearably bitter to think that on each side
of<br>
various frontiers young men were being trained to sing themselves
to<br>
death, in a struggle which was hideously impersonal, a struggle
of<br>
machinery, in which the only winners were the armament
manufacturers.<br>
And crazy pacifists might draw a very sharp line indeed between
the<br>
songs which celebrated real personal struggles in the tiny wars
of the<br>
past, and the songs which were merely the prelude to thousands
of<br>
puzzled young men suddenly finding themselves choking in chlorine
gas,<br>
in the wars of the present.</p>

<p>But even the craziest pacifist could not fail to be moved by
some of the<br>
ballads of the last war. To me, "Tipperary" is still the most
moving<br>
tune in the world. It happens to be a very good tune, from
the<br>
musician's point of view, a tune that Handel would not have been
ashamed<br>
to write, but that is not the point. Its emotional qualities are
due to<br>
its associations. Perhaps that is how it has always been, with
ballads.<br>
From the standard of pure aesthetics, one ought not to
consider<br>
"associations" in judging a poem or a tune, but with a song
like<br>
"Tipperary" you would be an inhuman prig if you didn't. We all
have our<br>
"associations" with this particular tune. For me, it recalls a
window in<br>
Hampstead, on a grey day in October 1914. I had been having the
measles,<br>
and had not been allowed to go back to school. Then suddenly,
down the<br>
street, that tune echoed. And they came marching, and marching,
and<br>
marching. And they were all so happy.</p>

<p>So happy.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>VII</h3>

<p>"Tipperary" is a true ballad, which is why it is included in
this book.<br>
So is "John Brown's Body". They were not written as ballads but
they<br>
have been promoted to that proud position by popular vote.</p>

<p>It will now be clear, from the foregoing remarks, that there
are<br>
thousands of poems, labelled "ballads" from the eighteenth
century,<br>
through the romantic movement, and onwards, which are not ballads
at<br>
all. Swinburne's ballads, which so shocked our grandparents, bore
about<br>
as much relation to the true ballads as a vase of wax fruit to
a<br>
hawker's barrow. They were lovely patterns of words, woven like
some<br>
exquisite, foaming lace, but they were Swinburne, Swinburne all
the<br>
time. They had nothing to do with the common people. The common
people<br>
would not have understood a word of them.</p>

<p>Ballads <i>must</i> be popular. And that is why it will always
remain<br>
one of the weirdest paradoxes of literature that the only man,
except<br>
Kipling, who has written a true ballad in the last fifty years is
the<br>
man who despised the people, who shrank from them, and jeered at
them,<br>
from his little gilded niche in Piccadilly. I refer, of course,
to Oscar<br>
Wilde's "Ballad of Reading Gaol." It was a true ballad, and it
was the<br>
best thing he ever wrote. For it was written <i>de profundis</i>,
when<br>
his hands were bloody with labour and his tortured spirit had
been down<br>
to the level of the lowest, to the level of the pavement ... nay,
lower<br>
... to the gutter itself. And in the gutter, with agony, he
learned the<br>
meaning of song.</p>

<p>Ballads begin and end with the people. You cannot escape that
fact. And<br>
therefore, if I wished to collect the ballads of the future, the
songs<br>
which will endure into the next century (if there <i>is</i> any
song in<br>
the next century), I should not rake through the contemporary
poets, in<br>
the hope of finding gems of lasting brilliance. No. I should go
to the<br>
music-halls. I should listen to the sort of thing they sing when
the<br>
faded lady with the high bust steps forward and shouts, "Now
then, boys,<br>
all together!"</p>

<p>Unless you can write the words "Now then, boys, all together",
at the<br>
top of a ballad, it is not really a ballad at all. That may sound
a<br>
sweeping statement, but it is true.</p>

<p>In the present-day music-halls, although they have fallen from
their<br>
high estate, we should find a number of these songs which seem
destined<br>
for immortality. One of these is "Don't 'ave any more, Mrs.
Moore."</p>

<p>Do you remember it?</p>

<p>  Don't 'ave any more, Mrs. Moore!<br>
  Mrs. Moore, oh don't 'ave any more!<br>
  Too many double gins<br>
  Give the ladies double chins,<br>
  So don't 'ave any more, Mrs. Moore!</p>

<p>The whole of English "low life" (which is much the most
exciting part of<br>
English life) is in that lyric. It is as vivid as a Rowlandson
cartoon.<br>
How well we know Mrs. Moore! How plainly we see her ... the
amiable,<br>
coarse-mouthed, generous-hearted tippler, with her elbow on
countless<br>
counters, her damp coppers clutched in her rough hands, her
eyes<br>
staring, a little vacantly, about her. Some may think it is a
sordid<br>
picture, but I am sure that they cannot know Mrs. Moore very well
if<br>
they think that. They cannot know her bitter struggles, her
silent<br>
heroisms, nor her sardonic humour.</p>

<p>Lyrics such as these will, I believe, endure long after many
of the most<br>
renowned and fashionable poets of to-day are forgotten. They all
have<br>
the same quality, that they can be prefaced by that inspiring
sentence,<br>
"Now then, boys--all together!" Or to put it another way, as in
the<br>
ballad of George Barnwell,</p>

<p>  All youths of fair England<br>
  That dwell both far and near,<br>
  Regard my story that I tell<br>
  And to my song give ear.</p>

<p>That may sound more dignified, but it amounts to the same
thing!</p>
<br><br>
<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>But if the generation to come will learn a great deal from the
few<br>
popular ballads which we are still creating in our music-halls,
how much<br>
more shall we learn of history from these ballads, which rang
through<br>
the whole country, and were impregnated with the spirit of a
whole<br>
people! These ballads <i>are</i> history, and as such they should
be<br>
recognised.</p>

<p>It has always seemed to me that we teach history in the wrong
way. We<br>
give boys the impression that it is an affair only of kings and
queens<br>
and great statesmen, of generals and admirals, and such-like
bores.<br>
Thousands of boys could probably draw you a map of many
pettifogging<br>
little campaigns, with startling accuracy, but not one in a
thousand<br>
could tell you what the private soldier carried in his knapsack.
You<br>
could get sheaves of competent essays, from any school, dealing
with<br>
such things as the Elizabethan ecclesiastical settlement, but how
many<br>
boys could tell you, even vaguely, what an English home was like,
what<br>
they ate, what coins were used, how their rooms were lit, and
what they<br>
paid their servants?</p>

<p>In other words, how many history masters ever take the trouble
to sketch<br>
in the great background, the life of the common people? How many
even<br>
realize their <i>existence</i>, except on occasions of
national<br>
disaster, such as the Black Plague?</p>

<p>A proper study of the ballads would go a long way towards
remedying this<br>
defect. Thomas Percy, whose <i>Reliques</i> must ever be the main
source<br>
of our information on all questions connected with ballads, has
pointed<br>
out that all the great events of the country have, sooner or
later,<br>
found their way into the country's song-book. But it is not only
the<br>
resounding names that are celebrated. In the ballads we hear the
echoes<br>
of the street, the rude laughter and the pointed jests. Sometimes
these<br>
ring so plainly that they need no explanation. At other times, we
have<br>
to go to Percy or to some of his successors to realize the
true<br>
significance of the song.</p>

<p>For example, the famous ballad "John Anderson my Jo" seems, at
first<br>
sight, to be innocent of any polemical intention. But it was
written<br>
during the Reformation when, as Percy dryly observes, "the Muses
were<br>
deeply engaged in religious controversy." The zeal of the
Scottish<br>
reformers was at its height, and this zeal found vent in many a
pasquil<br>
discharged at Popery. It caused them, indeed, in their frenzy,
to<br>
compose songs which were grossly licentious, and to sing these
songs in<br>
rasping voices to the tunes of some of the most popular hymns in
the<br>
Latin Service.</p>

<p>"John Anderson my Jo" was such a ballad composed for such an
occasion.<br>
And Percy, who was more qualified than any other man to read
between the<br>
lines, has pointed out that the first stanza contains a
satirical<br>
allusion to the luxury of the popish clergy, while the second,
which<br>
makes an apparently light reference to "seven bairns", is
actually<br>
concerned with the seven sacraments, five of which were the
spurious<br>
offspring of Mother Church.</p>

<p>Thus it was in a thousand cases. The ballads, even the
lightest and most<br>
blossoming of them, were deep-rooted in the soil of English
history. How<br>
different from anything that we possess to-day! Great causes do
not lead<br>
men to song, nowadays they lead them to write letters to the
newspapers.<br>
A national thanksgiving cannot call forth a single rhyme or a
single bar<br>
of music. Who can remember a solitary verse of thanksgiving, from
any of<br>
our poets, in commemoration of any of the victories of the Great
War?<br>
Who can recall even a fragment of verse in praise of the
long-deferred<br>
coming of Peace?</p>

<p>Very deeply significant is it that our only method of
commemorating<br>
Armistice Day was by a two minutes silence. No song. No music.
Nothing.<br>
The best thing we could do, we felt, was to keep quiet.</p>

<h2><a name="THE FROLICKSOME DUKE">THE FROLICKSOME DUKE</a></h2>

<p>or</p>

<h3>THE TINKER'S GOOD FORTUNE</h3>
<img alt="036.jpg (17K)" src="images/036.jpg" height="193" width="240">
<br><br>

<p>  Now as fame does report a young duke keeps a court,<br>
  One that pleases his fancy with frolicksome sport:<br>
  But amongst all the rest, here is one I protest,<br>
  Which will make you to smile when you hear the true jest:<br>
  A poor tinker he found, lying drunk on the ground,<br>
  As secure in a sleep as if laid in a swound.</p>

<p>  The Duke said to his men, William, Richard, and Ben,<br>
  Take him home to my palace, we'll sport with him then.<br>
  O'er a horse he was laid, and with care soon convey'd<br>
  To the palace, altho' he was poorly arrai'd:<br>
  Then they stript off his cloaths, both his shirt, shoes and
hose,<br>
  And they put him to bed for to take his repose.</p>

<p>  Having pull'd off his shirt, which was all over durt,<br>
  They did give him clean holland, this was no great hurt:<br>
  On a bed of soft down, like a lord of renown,<br>
  They did lay him to sleep the drink out of his crown.<br>
  In the morning when day, then admiring he lay,<br>
  For to see the rich chamber both gaudy and gay.</p>

<p>  Now he lay something late, in his rich bed of state,<br>
  Till at last knights and squires they on him did wait;<br>
  And the chamberling bare, then did likewise declare,<br>
  He desired to know what apparel he'd ware:<br>
  The poor tinker amaz'd on the gentleman gaz'd,<br>
  And admired how he to this honour was rais'd.</p>

<p>  Tho' he seem'd something mute, yet he chose a rich suit,<br>
  Which he straitways put on without longer dispute;<br>
  With a star on his side, which the tinker offt ey'd,<br>
  And it seem'd for to swell him "no" little with pride;<br>
  For he said to himself, Where is Joan my sweet wife?<br>
  Sure she never did see me so fine in her life.</p>

<p>  From a convenient place, the right duke his good grace<br>
  Did observe his behaviour in every case.<br>
  To a garden of state, on the tinker they wait,<br>
  Trumpets sounding before him: thought he, this is great:<br>
  Where an hour or two, pleasant walks he did view,<br>
  With commanders and squires in scarlet and blew.</p>

<p>  A fine dinner was drest, both for him and his guests,<br>
  He was plac'd at the table above all the rest,<br>
  In a rich chair "or bed," lin'd with fine crimson red,<br>
  With a rich golden canopy over his head:<br>
  As he sat at his meat, the musick play'd sweet,<br>
  With the choicest of singing his joys to compleat.</p>

<p>  While the tinker did dine, he had plenty of wine,<br>
  Rich canary with sherry and tent superfine.<br>
  Like a right honest soul, faith, he took off his bowl,<br>
  Till at last he began for to tumble and roul<br>
  From his chair to the floor, where he sleeping did snore,<br>
  Being seven times drunker than ever before.</p>

<p>  Then the duke did ordain, they should strip him amain,<br>
  And restore him his old leather garments again:<br>
  'T was a point next the worst, yet perform it they must,<br>
  And they carry'd him strait, where they found him at first;<br>
  There he slept all the night, as indeed well he might;<br>
  But when he did waken, his joys took their flight.</p>

<p>  For his glory "to him" so pleasant did seem,<br>
  That he thought it to be but a meer golden dream;<br>
  Till at length he was brought to the duke, where he sought<br>
  For a pardon, as fearing he had set him at nought;<br>
  But his highness he said, Thou 'rt a jolly bold blade,<br>
  Such a frolick before I think never was plaid.</p>

<p>  Then his highness bespoke him a new suit and cloak,<br>
  Which he gave for the sake of this frolicksome joak;<br>
  Nay, and five-hundred pound, with ten acres of ground,<br>
  Thou shalt never, said he, range the counteries round,<br>
  Crying old brass to mend, for I'll be thy good friend,<br>
  Nay, and Joan thy sweet wife shall my duchess attend.</p>

<p>  Then the tinker reply'd, What! must Joan my sweet bride<br>
  Be a lady in chariots of pleasure to ride?<br>
  Must we have gold and land ev'ry day at command?<br>
  Then I shall be a squire I well understand:<br>
  Well I thank your good grace, and your love I embrace,<br>
  I was never before in so happy a case.</p>

  The were as bolde men in their deeds,<br>
    As any were farr and neare.</p>

<p>  As they were drinking ale and wine<br>
    Within kyng Estmeres halle:<br>
  When will ye marry a wyfe, broth&egrave;r,<br>
    A wyfe to glad us all?</p>

<p>  Then bespake him kyng Estmere,<br>
    And answered him hastilee:<br>
  I know not that ladye in any land<br>
    That's able to marrye with mee.</p>

<p>  Kyng Adland hath a daughter, brother,<br>
    Men call her bright and sheene;<br>
  If I were kyng here in your stead,<br>
    That ladye shold be my queene.</p>

<p>  Saies, Reade me, reade me, deare brother,<br>
    Throughout merry Engl&agrave;nd,<br>
  Where we might find a messenger<br>
    Betwixt us towe to sende.</p>

<p>  Saies, You shal ryde yourselfe, broth&egrave;r,<br>
    Ile beare you companye;<br>
  Many throughe fals messengers are deceived,<br>
    And I feare lest soe shold wee.</p>

<p>  Thus the renisht them to ryde<br>
    Of twoe good renisht steeds,<br>
  And when the came to kyng Adlands halle,<br>
    Of redd gold shone their weeds.</p>

<p>  And when the came to kyng Adlands hall<br>
    Before the goodlye gate,<br>
  There they found good kyng Adl&agrave;nd<br>
    Rearing himselfe theratt.</p>

<p>  Now Christ thee save, good kyng Adland;<br>
   Now Christ you save and see.<br>
  Sayd, You be welcome, kyng Estmere,<br>
   Right hartilye to mee.</p>

<p>  You have a daughter, said Adler younge,<br>
   Men call her bright and sheene,<br>
  My brother wold marrye her to his wiffe,<br>
   Of Englande to be queene.</p>

<p>  Yesterday was att my deere daughter<br>
   Syr Bremor the kyng of Spayne;<br>
  And then she nicked him of naye,<br>
   And I doubt sheele do you the same.</p>

<p>  The kyng of Spayne is a foule paynim,<br>
   And 'leeveth on Mahound;<br>
  And pitye it were that fayre ladye<br>
   Shold marrye a heathen hound.</p>

<p>  But grant to me, sayes kyng Estmere,<br>
   For my love I you praye;<br>
  That I may see your daughter deere<br>
   Before I goe hence awaye.</p>

<p>  Although itt is seven yeers and more<br>
   Since my daughter was in halle,<br>
  She shall come once downe for your sake<br>
   To glad my guestes alle.</p>

<p>  Downe then came that mayden fayre,<br>
    With ladyes laced in pall,<br>
  And halfe a hundred of bold knightes,<br>
    To bring her from bowre to hall;<br>
  And as many gentle squiers,<br>
    To tend upon them all.</p>

<p>  The talents of golde were on her head sette,<br>
    Hanged low downe to her knee;<br>
  And everye ring on her small fing&egrave;r<br>
    Shone of the chrystall free.</p>

<p>  Saies, God you save, my deere madam;<br>
    Saies, God you save and see.<br>
  Said, You be welcome, kyng Estmere,<br>
    Right welcome unto mee.</p>

<p>  And if you love me, as you saye,<br>
    Soe well and hartilye,<br>
  All that ever you are comin about<br>
    Sooner sped now itt shal bee.</p>

<p>  Then bespake her father deare:<br>
    My daughter, I saye naye;<br>
  Remember well the kyng of Spayne,<br>
    What he sayd yesterday.</p>

<p>  He wold pull downe my hales and castles,<br>
     And reeve me of my life.<br>
  I cannot blame him if he doe,<br>
     If I reave him of his wyfe.</p>

<p>  Your castles and your towres, father,<br>
     Are stronglye built aboute;<br>
  And therefore of the king of Spaine<br>
     Wee neede not stande in doubt.</p>

<p>  Plight me your troth, nowe, kyng Estm&egrave;re,<br>
     By heaven and your righte hand,<br>
  That you will marrye me to your wyfe,<br>
     And make me queene of your land.</p>

<p>  Then kyng Estmere he plight his troth<br>
     By heaven and his righte hand,<br>
  That he wolde marrye her to his wyfe,<br>
     And make her queene of his land.</p>

<p>  And he tooke leave of that ladye fayre,<br>
     To goe to his owne countree,<br>
  To fetche him dukes and lordes and knightes,<br>
     That marryed the might bee.</p>

<p>  They had not ridden scant a myle,<br>
     A myle forthe of the towne,<br>
  But in did come the kyng of Spayne,<br>
     With kemp&egrave;s many one.</p>

<p>  But in did come the kyng of Spayne,<br>
     With manye a bold barone,<br>
  Tone day to marrye kyng Adlands daughter,<br>
     Tother daye to carrye her home.</p>

<p>  Shee sent one after kyng Estmere<br>
     In all the spede might bee,<br>
  That he must either turne againe and fighte,<br>
     Or goe home and loose his ladye.</p>

<p>  One whyle then the page he went,<br>
     Another while he ranne;<br>
  Tull he had oretaken king Estmere,<br>
      I wis, he never blanne.</p>

<p>  Tydings, tydings, kyng Estmere!<br>
     What tydinges nowe, my boye?<br>
  O tydinges I can tell to you,<br>
     That will you sore annoye.</p>

<p>  You had not ridden scant a mile,<br>
     A mile out of the towne,<br>
  But in did come the kyng of Spayne<br>
     With kemp&egrave;s many a one:</p>

<p>  But in did come the kyng of Spayne<br>
     With manye a bold barone,<br>
  Tone daye to marrye king Adlands daughter,<br>
     Tother daye to carry her home.</p>

<p>  My ladye fayre she greetes you well,<br>
   And ever-more well by mee:<br>
  You must either turne againe and fighte,<br>
   Or goe home and loose your lady&egrave;.</p>

<p>  Saies, Reade me, reade me, deere brother,<br>
   My reade shall ryde at thee,<br>
  Whether it is better to turne and fighte,<br>
   Or goe home and loose my ladye.</p>

<p>  Now hearken to me, sayes Adler yonge,<br>
   And your reade must rise at me,<br>
  I quicklye will devise a waye<br>
   To sette thy ladye free.</p>

<p>  My mother was a westerne woman,<br>
   And learned in gramary&egrave;,<br>
  And when I learned at the schole,<br>
   Something she taught itt mee.</p>

<p>  There growes an hearbe within this field,<br>
   And iff it were but knowne,<br>
  His color, which is whyte and redd,<br>
   It will make blacke and browne:</p>

<p>  His color, which is browne and blacke,<br>
   Itt will make redd and whyte;<br>
  That sworde is not in all Englande,<br>
   Upon his coate will byte.</p>

<p>  And you shall be a harper, brother,<br>
    Out of the north countrye;<br>
  And He be your boy, soe faine of fighte,<br>
    And beare your harpe by your knee.</p>

<p>  And you shal be the best harp&egrave;r,<br>
    That ever tooke harpe in hand;<br>
  And I wil be the best sing&egrave;r,<br>
    That ever sung in this lande.</p>

<p>  Itt shal be written on our forheads<br>
    All and in grammary&egrave;,<br>
  That we towe are the boldest men,<br>
    That are in all Christenty&egrave;.</p>

<p>  And thus they renisht them to ryde,<br>
    On tow good renish steedes;<br>
  And when they came to king Adlands hall,<br>
    Of redd gold shone their weedes.</p>

<p>  And whan they came to kyng Adlands hall,<br>
    Untill the fayre hall yate,<br>
  There they found a proud port&egrave;r<br>
    Rearing himselfe thereatt.</p>

<p>  Sayes, Christ thee save, thou proud port&egrave;r;<br>
    Sayes, Christ thee save and see.<br>
  Nowe you be welcome, sayd the port&egrave;r,<br>
    Of whatsoever land ye bee.</p>

<p>  Wee beene harpers, sayd Adler younge,<br>
    Come out of the northe countrye;<br>
  Wee beene come hither untill this place,<br>
    This proud weddinge for to see.</p>

<p>  Sayd, And your color were white and redd,<br>
    As it is blacke and browne,<br>
  I wold saye king Estmere and his brother,<br>
    Were comen untill this towne.</p>

<p>  Then they pulled out a ryng of gold,<br>
    Layd itt on the porters arme:<br>
  And ever we will thee, proud porter,<br>
    Thow wilt saye us no harme.</p>

<p>  Sore he looked on king Estmere,<br>
    And sore he handled the ryng,<br>
  Then opened to them the fayre hall yates,<br>
    He lett for no kind of thyng.</p>

<p>  King Estmere he stabled his steede<br>
    Soe fayre att the hall bord;<br>
  The froth, that came from his brydle bitte,<br>
    Light in kyng Bremors beard.</p>

<p>  Saies, Stable thy steed, thou proud harper,<br>
    Saies, Stable him in the stalle;<br>
  It doth not beseeme a proud harper<br>
    To stable 'him' in a kyngs halle.</p>

<p>  My ladde he is no lither, he said,<br>
    He will doe nought that's meete;<br>
  And is there any man in this hall<br>
    Were able him to beate</p>

<p>  Thou speakst proud words, sayes the king of Spaine,<br>
    Thou harper, here to mee:<br>
  There is a man within this halle<br>
    Will beate thy ladd and thee.</p>

<p>  O let that man come downe, he said,<br>
    A sight of him wold I see;<br>
  And when hee hath beaten well my ladd,<br>
    Then he shall beate of mee.</p>

<p>  Downe then came the kemperye man,<br>
    And looketh him in the eare;<br>
  For all the gold, that was under heaven,<br>
    He durst not neigh him neare.</p>

<p>  And how nowe, kempe, said the Kyng of Spaine,<br>
    And how what aileth thee?<br>
  He saies, It is writt in his forhead<br>
    All and in gramary&egrave;,<br>
  That for all the gold that is under heaven<br>
    I dare not neigh him nye.</p>

<p>  Then Kyng Estmere pulld forth his harpe,<br>
    And plaid a pretty thinge:<br>
  The ladye upstart from the borde,<br>
    And wold have gone from the king.</p>

<p>  Stay thy harpe, thou proud harper,<br>
    For Gods love I pray thee,<br>
  For and thou playes as thou beginns,<br>
    Thou'lt till my bryde from mee.</p>

<p>  He stroake upon his harpe againe,<br>
    And playd a pretty thinge;<br>
  The ladye lough a loud laughter,<br>
    As shee sate by the king.</p>

<p>  Saies, Sell me thy harpe, thou proud harper,<br>
    And thy stringes all,<br>
  For as many gold nobles 'thou shall have'<br>
    As heere bee ringes in the hall.</p>

<p>  What wold ye doe with my harpe,' he sayd,'<br>
    If I did sell itt yee?<br>
  "To playe my wiffe and me a fitt,<br>
    When abed together wee bee."</p>

<p>  Now sell me, quoth hee, thy bryde soe gay,<br>
    As shee sitts by thy knee,<br>
  And as many gold nobles I will give,<br>
    As leaves been on a tree.</p>

<p>  And what wold ye doe with my bryde soe gay,<br>
    Iff I did sell her thee?<br>
  More seemelye it is for her fayre bodye<br>
    To lye by mee then thee.</p>

<p>  Hee played agayne both loud and shrille,<br>
    And Adler he did syng,<br>
  "O ladye, this is thy owne true love;<br>
    Noe harper, but a kyng.</p>

<p>  "O ladye, this is thy owne true love,<br>
    As playnlye thou mayest see;<br>
  And He rid thee of that foule paynim,<br>
    Who partes thy love and thee."</p>

<p>  The ladye looked, the ladye blushte,<br>
    And blushte and lookt agayne,<br>
  While Adler he hath drawne his brande,<br>
    And hath the Sowdan slayne.</p>

<p>  Up then rose the kemperye men,<br>
    And loud they gan to crye:<br>
  Ah; traytors, yee have slayne our kyng,<br>
    And therefore yee shall dye.</p>

<p>  Kyng Estmere threwe the harpe asyde,<br>
    And swith he drew his brand;<br>
  And Estmere he, and Adler yonge<br>
    Right stiffe in slodr can stand.</p>

<p>  And aye their swordes soe sore can byte,<br>
    Throughe help of Gramary&egrave;,<br>
  That soone they have slayne the kempery men,<br>
    Or forst them forth to flee.</p>

<p>  Kyng Estmere took that fayre ladye,<br>
    And marryed her to his wiffe,<br>
  And brought her home to merry England<br>
    With her to leade his life.</p>

<img alt="058.jpg (15K)" src="images/058.jpg" height="187" width="239">
<br><br>
<p>  An ancient story Ile tell you anon<br>
  Of a notable prince, that was called King John;<br>
  And he ruled England with maine and with might,<br>
  For he did great wrong, and maintein'd little right.</p>

<p>  And Ile tell you a story, a story so merrye,<br>
  Concerning the Abbot of Canterb&ugrave;rye;<br>
  How for his house-keeping, and high renowne,<br>
  They rode poste for him to fair London towne.</p>

<p>  An hundred men, the king did heare say,<br>
  The abbot kept in his house every day;<br>
  And fifty golde chaynes, without any doubt,<br>
  In velvet coates waited the abbot about.</p>

<p>  How now, father abbot, I heare it of thee,<br>
  Thou keepest a farre better house than mee,<br>
  And for thy house-keeping and high renowne,<br>
  I feare thou work'st treason against my crown.</p>

<p>  My liege, quo' the abbot, I would it were knowne,<br>
  I never spend nothing, but what is my owne;<br>
  And I trust, your grace will doe me no deere,<br>
  For spending of my owne true-gotten geere.</p>

<p>  Yes, yes, father abbot, thy fault it is highe,<br>
  And now for the same thou needest must dye;<br>
  For except thou canst answer me questions three,<br>
  Thy head shall be smitten from thy bod&igrave;e.</p>

<p>  And first, quo' the king, when I'm in this stead,<br>
  With my crowne of golde so faire on my head,<br>
  Among all my liege-men so noble of birthe,<br>
  Thou must tell me to one penny what I am worthe.</p>

<p>  Secondlye, tell me, without any doubt,<br>
  How soone I may ride the whole world about.<br>
  And at the third question thou must not shrink,<br>
  But tell me here truly what I do think.</p>

<p>  O, these are hard questions for my shallow witt,<br>
  Nor I cannot answer your grace as yet:<br>
  But if you will give me but three weekes space,<br>
  Ile do my endeavour to answer your grace.</p>

<p>  Now three weeks space to thee will I give,<br>
  And that is the longest time thou hast to live;<br>
  For if thou dost not answer my questions three,<br>
  Thy lands and thy livings are forfeit to mee.</p>

<p>  Away rode the abbot all sad at that word,<br>
  And he rode to Cambridge, and Oxenford;<br>
  But never a doctor there was so wise,<br>
  That could with his learning an answer devise.</p>

<p>  Then home rode the abbot of comfort so cold,<br>
  And he mett his shepheard a going to fold:<br>
  How now, my lord abbot, you are welcome home;<br>
  What newes do you bring us from good King John?</p>

<p>  "Sad newes, sad newes, shepheard, I must give;<br>
  That I have but three days more to live:<br>
  For if I do not answer him questions three,<br>
  My head will be smitten from my bodie.</p>

<p>  The first is to tell him there in that stead,<br>
  With his crowne of golde so fair on his head,<br>
  Among all his liege men so noble of birth,<br>
  To within one penny of all what he is worth.</p>

<p>  The seconde, to tell him, without any doubt,<br>
  How soon he may ride this whole world about:<br>
  And at the third question I must not shrinke,<br>
  But tell him there truly what he does thinke."</p>

<p>  Now cheare up, sire abbot, did you never hear yet,<br>
  That a fool he may learn a wise man witt?<br>
  Lend me horse, and serving men, and your apparel,<br>
  And I'll ride to London to answere your quarrel.</p>

<p>  Nay frowne not, if it hath bin told unto mee,<br>
  I am like your lordship, as ever may bee:<br>
  And if you will but lend me your gowne,<br>
  There is none shall knowe us at fair London towne.</p>

<p>  Now horses, and serving-men thou shalt have,<br>
  With sumptuous array most gallant and brave;<br>
  With crozier, and miter, and rochet, and cope,<br>
  Fit to appeare 'fore our fader the pope.</p>

<p>  Now welcome, sire abbott, the king he did say,<br>
  'Tis well thou'rt come back to keep thy day;<br>
  For and if thou canst answer my questions three,<br>
  Thy life and thy living both saved shall bee.</p>

<p>  And first, when thou seest me here in this stead,<br>
  With my crowne of gold so fair on my head,<br>
  Among all my liege-men so noble of birthe,<br>
  Tell me to one penny what I am worth.</p>

<p>  "For thirty pence our Saviour was sold<br>
  Amonge the false Jewes, as I have bin told;<br>
  And twenty nine is the worth of thee,<br>
  For I thinke, thou art one penny worser than hee."</p>

<p>  The king he laughed, and swore by St. Bittel,<br>
  I did not thinke I had been worth so littel!<br>
  --Now secondly tell me, without any doubt,<br>
  How soon I may ride this whole world about.</p>

<p>  "You must rise with the sun, and ride with the same,<br>
  Until the next morning he riseth againe;<br>
  And then your grace need not make any doubt,<br>
  But in twenty-four hours you'll ride it about."</p>

<p>  The king he laughed, and swore by St. Jone,<br>
  I did not think, it could be gone so soone!<br>
  --Now from the third question thou must not shrinke,<br>
  But tell me here truly what I do thinke.</p>

<p>  "Yea, that shall I do, and make your grace merry:<br>
  You thinke I'm the Abbot of Canterb&ugrave;ry;<br>
  But I'm his poor shepheard, as plain you may see,<br>
  That am come to beg pardon for him and for mee."</p>

<p>  The king he laughed, and swore by the masse,<br>
  He make thee lord abbot this day in his place!<br>
  "Now naye, my liege, be not in such speede,<br>
  For alacke I can neither write ne reade."</p>

<p>  Four nobles a weeke, then I will give thee,<br>
  For this merry jest thou hast showne unto mee;<br>
  And tell the old abbot, when thou comest home,<br>
  Thou hast brought him a pardon from good King John.</p>

    Appeard to each mans sight;<br>
  Her sparkling eyes, like Orient pearles,<br>
    Did cast a heavenlye light.</p>

<p>  The blood within her crystal cheekes<br>
    Did such a colour drive,<br>
  As though the lillye and the rose<br>
    For mastership did strive.</p>

<p>  Yea Rosamonde, fair Rosamonde,<br>
    Her name was called so,<br>
  To whom our queene, dame Ellinor,<br>
    Was known a deadlye foe.</p>

<p>  The king therefore, for her defence,<br>
    Against the furious queene,<br>
  At Woodstocke builded such a bower,<br>
    The like was never scene.</p>

<p>  Most curiously that bower was built<br>
    Of stone and timber strong,<br>
  An hundred and fifty doors<br>
   Did to this bower belong:</p>

<p>  And they so cunninglye contriv'd<br>
    With turnings round about,<br>
  That none but with a clue of thread,<br>
    Could enter in or out.</p>

<p>  And for his love and ladyes sake,<br>
    That was so faire and brighte,<br>
  The keeping of this bower he gave<br>
    Unto a valiant knighte.</p>

<p>  But fortune, that doth often frowne<br>
    Where she before did smile,<br>
  The kinges delighte and ladyes so<br>
    Full soon shee did beguile:</p>

<p>  For why, the kinges ungracious sonne,<br>
    Whom he did high advance,<br>
  Against his father raised warres<br>
    Within the realme of France.</p>

<p>  But yet before our comelye king<br>
    The English land forsooke,<br>
  Of Rosamond, his lady faire,<br>
    His farewelle thus he tooke:</p>

<p>  "My Rosamonde, my only Rose,<br>
    That pleasest best mine eye:<br>
  The fairest flower in all the worlde<br>
    To feed my fantasye:</p>

<p>  The flower of mine affected heart,<br>
    Whose sweetness doth excelle:<br>
  My royal Rose, a thousand times<br>
    I bid thee nowe farwelle!</p>

<p>  For I must leave my fairest flower,<br>
    My sweetest Rose, a space,<br>
  And cross the seas to famous France,<br>
    Proud rebelles to abase.</p>

<p>  But yet, my Rose, be sure thou shalt<br>
    My coming shortlye see,<br>
  And in my heart, when hence I am,<br>
    Ile beare my Rose with mee."</p>

<p>  When Rosamond, that ladye brighte,<br>
    Did heare the king saye soe,<br>
  The sorrowe of her grieved heart<br>
    Her outward lookes did showe;</p>

<p>  And from her cleare and crystall eyes<br>
    The teares gusht out apace,<br>
  Which like the silver-pearled dewe<br>
    Ranne downe her comely face.</p>

<p>  Her lippes, erst like the corall redde,<br>
    Did waxe both wan and pale,<br>
  And for the sorrow she conceivde<br>
    Her vitall spirits faile;</p>

<p>  And falling down all in a swoone<br>
    Before King Henryes face,<br>
  Full oft he in his princelye armes<br>
    Her bodye did embrace:</p>

<p>  And twentye times, with watery eyes,<br>
    He kist her tender cheeke,<br>
  Untill he had revivde againe<br>
    Her senses milde and meeke.</p>

<p>  Why grieves my Rose, my sweetest Rose?<br>
    The king did often say.<br>
  Because, quoth shee, to bloodye warres<br>
    My lord must part awaye.</p>

<p>  But since your grace on forrayne coastes<br>
    Amonge your foes unkinde<br>
  Must goe to hazard life and limbe,<br>
    Why should I staye behinde?</p>

<p>  Nay rather, let me, like a page,<br>
    Your sworde and target beare;<br>
  That on my breast the blowes may lighte,<br>
    Which would offend you there.</p>

<p>  Or lett mee, in your royal tent,<br>
    Prepare your bed at nighte,<br>
  And with sweete baths refresh your grace,<br>
    Ar your returne from fighte.</p>

<p>  So I your presence may enjoye<br>
    No toil I will refuse;<br>
  But wanting you, my life is death;<br>
    Nay, death Ild rather chuse!</p>

<p>  "Content thy self, my dearest love;<br>
    Thy rest at home shall bee<br>
  In Englandes sweet and pleasant isle;<br>
    For travell fits not thee.</p>

<p>  Faire ladies brooke not bloodye warres;<br>
    Soft peace their sexe delights;<br>
  Not rugged campes, but courtlye bowers;<br>
    Gay feastes, not cruell fights.'</p>

<p>  My Rose shall safely here abide,<br>
    With musicke passe the daye;<br>
  Whilst I, amonge the piercing pikes,<br>
    My foes seeke far awaye.</p>

<p>  My Rose shall shine in pearle, and golde,<br>
    Whilst Ime in armour dighte;<br>
  Gay galliards here my love shall dance,<br>
    Whilst I my foes goe fighte.</p>

<p>  And you, Sir Thomas, whom I truste<br>
    To bee my loves defence;<br>
  Be careful of my gallant Rose<br>
    When I am parted hence."</p>

<p>  And therewithall he fetcht a sigh,<br>
    As though his heart would breake:<br>
  And Rosamonde, for very grief,<br>
    Not one plaine word could speake.</p>

<p>  And at their parting well they mighte<br>
    In heart be grieved sore:<br>
  After that daye faire Rosamonde<br>
    The king did see no more.</p>

<p>  For when his grace had past the seas,<br>
    And into France was gone;<br>
  With envious heart, Queene Ellinor,<br>
    To Woodstocke came anone.</p>

<p>  And forth she calls this trustye knighte,<br>
    In an unhappy houre;<br>
  Who with his clue of twined thread,<br>
    Came from this famous bower.</p>

<p>  And when that they had wounded him,<br>
    The queene this thread did gette,<br>
  And went where Ladye Rosamonde<br>
    Was like an angell sette.</p>

<p>  But when the queene with stedfast eye<br>
    Beheld her beauteous face,<br>
  She was amazed in her minde<br>
    At her exceeding grace.</p>

<p>  Cast off from thee those robes, she said,<br>
    That riche and costlye bee;<br>
  And drinke thou up this deadlye draught,<br>
    Which I have brought to thee.</p>

<p>  Then presentlye upon her knees<br>
    Sweet Rosamonde did fall;<br>
  And pardon of the queene she crav'd<br>
    For her offences all.</p>

<p>  "Take pitty on my youthfull yeares,"<br>
    Faire Rosamonde did crye;<br>
  "And lett mee not with poison stronge<br>
    Enforced bee to dye.</p>

<p>  I will renounce my sinfull life,<br>
    And in some cloyster bide;<br>
  Or else be banisht, if you please,<br>
    To range the world soe wide.</p>

<p>  And for the fault which I have done,<br>
    Though I was forc'd thereto,<br>
  Preserve my life, and punish mee<br>
    As you thinke meet to doe."</p>

<p>  And with these words, her lillie handes<br>
    She wrunge full often there;<br>
  And downe along her lovely face<br>
    Did trickle many a teare.</p>

<p>  But nothing could this furious queene<br>
    Therewith appeased bee;<br>
  The cup of deadlye poyson stronge,<br>
    As she knelt on her knee,</p>

<p>  Shee gave this comelye dame to drinke;<br>
    Who tooke it in her hand,<br>
  And from her bended knee arose,<br>
    And on her feet did stand:</p>

<p>  And casting up her eyes to heaven,<br>
    She did for mercye calle;<br>
  And drinking up the poison stronge,<br>
    Her life she lost withalle.</p>

<p>  And when that death through everye limbe<br>
    Had showde its greatest spite,<br>
  Her chiefest foes did plaine confesse<br>
    Shee was a glorious wight.</p>

<p>  Her body then they did entomb,<br>
    When life was fled away,<br>
  At Godstowe, neare to Oxford towne,<br>
    As may be scene this day.</p>

<br><br>

<p>  When shaws beene sheene, and shradds full fayre,<br>
    And leaves both large and longe,<br>
  Itt is merrye walking in the fayre forrest<br>
    To heare the small birdes songe.</p>

<p>  The woodweele sang, and wold not cease,<br>
    Sitting upon the spraye,<br>
  Soe lowde, he wakened Robin Hood,<br>
    In the greenwood where he lay.</p>

<p>  Now by my faye, sayd jollye Robin,<br>
    A sweaven I had this night;<br>
  I dreamt me of tow wighty yemen,<br>
    That fast with me can fight.</p>

<p>  Methought they did mee beate and binde,<br>
    And tooke my bow mee froe;<br>
  If I be Robin alive in this lande,<br>
    He be wroken on them towe.</p>

<p>  Sweavens are swift, Master, quoth John,<br>
    As the wind that blowes ore a hill;<br>
  For if itt be never so loude this night,<br>
    To-morrow itt may be still.</p>

<p>  Buske yee, bowne yee, my merry men all,<br>
    And John shall goe with mee,<br>
  For Ile goe seeke yond wight yeomen,<br>
    In greenwood where the bee.</p>

<p>  Then the cast on their gownes of grene,<br>
    And tooke theyr bowes each one;<br>
  And they away to the greene forrest<br>
    A shooting forth are gone;</p>

<p>  Until they came to the merry greenwood,<br>
    Where they had gladdest bee,<br>
  There were the ware of a wight yeoman,<br>
    His body leaned to a tree.</p>

<p>  A sword and a dagger he wore by his side,<br>
    Of manye a man the bane;<br>
  And he was clad in his capull hyde<br>
    Topp and tayll and mayne.</p>

<p>  Stand you still, master, quoth Litle John,<br>
    Under this tree so grene,<br>
  And I will go to yond wight yeoman<br>
    To know what he doth meane.</p>

<p>  Ah! John, by me thou settest noe store,<br>
    And that I farley finde:<br>
  How offt send I my men beffore<br>
    And tarry my selfe behinde?</p>

<p>  It is no cunning a knave to ken,<br>
    And a man but heare him speake;<br>
  And itt were not for bursting of my bowe.<br>
    John, I thy head wold breake.</p>

<p>  As often wordes they breeden bale,<br>
    So they parted Robin and John;<br>
  And John is gone to Barnesdale;<br>
    The gates he knoweth eche one.</p>

<p>  But when he came to Barnesdale,<br>
    Great heavinesse there hee hadd,<br>
  For he found tow of his owne fell&ograve;wes<br>
    Were slaine both in a slade.</p>

<p>  And Scarlette he was flyinge a-foote<br>
    Fast over stocke and stone,<br>
  For the sheriffe with seven score men<br>
    Fast after him is gone.</p>

<p>  One shoote now I will shoote, quoth John,<br>
    With Christ his might and mayne:<br>
  Ile make yond fellow that flyes soe fast,<br>
    To stopp he shall be fayne.</p>

<p>  Then John bent up his long bende-bowe,<br>
    And fetteled him to shoote:<br>
  The bow was made of a tender boughe,<br>
    And fell down to his foote.</p>

<p>  Woe worth, woe worth thee, wicked wood,<br>
    That ere thou grew on a tree;<br>
  For now this day thou art my bale,<br>
    My boote when thou shold bee.</p>

<p>  His shoote it was but loosely shott,<br>
    Yet flewe not the arrowe in vaine,<br>
  For itt mett one of the sheriffes men,<br>
    Good William a Trent was slaine.</p>

<p>  It had bene better of William a Trent<br>
    To have bene abed with sorrowe,<br>
  Than to be that day in the green wood slade<br>
    To meet with Little Johns arrowe.</p>

<p>  But as it is said, when men be mett<br>
    Fyve can doe more than three,<br>
  The sheriffe hath taken little John,<br>
    And bound him fast to a tree.</p>

<p>  Thou shalt be drawen by dale and downe,<br>
    And hanged hye on a hill.<br>
  But thou mayst fayle of thy purpose, quoth John,<br>
    If itt be Christ his will.</p>

<p>  Let us leave talking of Little John,<br>
    And thinke of Robin Hood,<br>
  How he is gone to the wight yeoman,<br>
    Where under the leaves he stood.</p>

<p>  Good morrowe, good fellowe, sayd Robin so fayre,<br>
    Good morrowe, good fellow, quoth he:<br>
   Methinkes by this bowe thou beares in thy hande<br>
    A good archere thou sholdst bee.</p>

<p>  I am wilfull of my waye, quo' the yeman,<br>
    And of my morning tyde.<br>
  He lead thee through the wood, sayd Robin;<br>
    Good fellow, He be thy guide.</p>

<p>  I seeke an outl&agrave;we, the straunger sayd,<br>
    Men call him Robin Hood;<br>
  Rather Ild meet with that proud outlawe,<br>
    Than fortye pound so good.</p>

<p>  Now come with me, thou wighty yeman,<br>
    And Robin thou soone shalt see:<br>
  But first let us some pastime find<br>
    Under the greenwood tree.</p>

<p>  First let us some masterye make<br>
    Among the woods so even,<br>
  Wee may chance to meet with Robin Hood<br>
    Here att some unsett steven.</p>

<p>  They cut them downe two summer shroggs,<br>
    That grew both under a breere,<br>
  And sett them threescore rood in twaine<br>
    To shoot the prickes y-fere:</p>

<p>  Lead on, good fellowe, quoth Robin Hood,<br>
    Lead on, I doe bidd thee.<br>
  Nay by my faith, good fellowe, hee sayd,<br>
    My leader thou shalt bee.</p>

<p>  The first time Robin shot at the pricke,<br>
    He mist but an inch it froe:<br>
  The yeoman he was an archer good,<br>
    But he cold never shoote soe.</p>

<p>  The second shoote had the wightye yeman,<br>
    He shote within the garl&agrave;nde:<br>
  But Robin he shott far better than hee,<br>
    For he clave the good pricke wande.</p>

<p>  A blessing upon thy heart, he sayd;<br>
    Good fellowe, thy shooting is goode;<br>
  For an thy hart be as good as thy hand,<br>
    Thou wert better then Robin Hoode.</p>

<p>  Now tell me thy name, good fellowe, sayd he,<br>
    Under the leaves of lyne.<br>
  Nay by my faith, quoth bolde Robin,<br>
    Till thou have told me thine.</p>

<p>  I dwell by dale and downe, quoth hee,<br>
    And Robin to take Ime sworne;<br>
  And when I am called by my right name<br>
    I am Guye of good Gisborne.</p>

<p>  My dwelling is in this wood, sayes Robin,<br>
    By thee I set right nought:<br>
  I am Robin Hood of Barn&egrave;sdale,<br>
    Whom thou so long hast sought.</p>

<p>  He that hath neither beene kithe nor kin,<br>
    Might have scene a full fayre sight,<br>
  To see how together these yeomen went<br>
    With blades both browne and bright.</p>

<p>  To see how these yeomen together they fought<br>
    Two howres of a summers day:<br>
  Yet neither Robin Hood nor Sir Guy<br>
    Them fettled to flye away.</p>

<p>  Robin was reachles on a roote,<br>
    And stumbled at that tyde;<br>
  And Guy was quick and nimble with-all,<br>
    And hitt him ore the left side.</p>

<p>  Ah deere Lady, sayd Robin Hood, 'thou<br>
    That art both mother and may,'<br>
  I think it was never mans destinye<br>
    To dye before his day.</p>

<p>  Robin thought on our ladye deere,<br>
    And soone leapt up againe,<br>
  And strait he came with a 'backward' stroke,<br>
    And he Sir Guy hath slayne.</p>

<p>  He took Sir Guys head by the hayre,<br>
    And sticked itt on his bowes end:<br>
  Thou hast beene a traytor all thy liffe,<br>
    Which thing must have an ende.</p>

<p>  Robin pulled forth an Irish kniffe,<br>
    And nicked Sir Guy in the face,<br>
  That he was never on woman born,<br>
    Cold tell whose head it was.</p>

<p>  Saies, Lye there, lye there, now Sir Guye,<br>
    And with me be not wrothe,<br>
  If thou have had the worst stroked at my hand,<br>
    Thou shalt have the better clothe.</p>

<p>  Robin did off his gowne of greene,<br>
    And on Sir Guy did it throwe,<br>
  And hee put on that capull hyde,<br>
    That cladd him topp to toe.</p>

<p>  The bowe, the arrowes, and litle home,<br>
    Now with me I will beare;<br>
  For I will away to Barnesdale,<br>
    To see how my men doe fare.</p>

<p>  Robin Hood sett Guyes horne to his mouth.<br>
    And a loud blast in it did blow.<br>
  That beheard the sheriffe of Nottingham,<br>
    As he leaned under a lowe.</p>

<p>  Hearken, hearken, sayd the sheriffe,<br>
    I heare now tydings good,<br>
  For yonder I heare Sir Guyes horne blowe,<br>
    And he hath slaine Robin Hoode.</p>

<p>  Yonder I heare Sir Guyes home blowe,<br>
    Itt blowes soe well in tyde,<br>
  And yonder comes that wightye yeoman,<br>
    Cladd in his capull hyde.</p>

<p>  Come hyther, come hyther, thou good Sir Guy,<br>
    Aske what thou wilt of mee.<br>
  O I will none of thy gold, sayd Robin,<br>
    Nor I will none of thy fee:</p>

<p>  But now I have slaine the master, he sayes,<br>
    Let me go strike the knave;<br>
  This is all the rewarde I aske;<br>
    Nor noe other will I have.</p>

<p>  Thou art a madman, said the sheriffe,<br>
    Thou sholdest have had a knights fee:<br>
  But seeing thy asking hath beene soe bad,<br>
    Well granted it shale be.</p>

<p>  When Litle John heard his master speake,<br>
    Well knewe he it was his steven:<br>
  Now shall I be looset, quoth Litle John,<br>
    With Christ his might in heaven.</p>

<p>  Fast Robin hee hyed him to Litle John,<br>
    He thought to loose him belive;<br>
  The sheriffe and all his companye<br>
    Fast after him did drive.<br>
  Stand abacke, stand abacke, sayd Robin;<br>
    Why draw you mee soe neere?<br>
  Itt was never the use in our countrye,<br>
    Ones shrift another shold heere.</p>

<p>  But Robin pulled forth an Irysh kniffe,<br>
    And losed John hand and foote,<br>
  And gave him Sir Guyes bow into his hand,<br>
    And bade it be his boote.</p>

<p>  Then John he took Guyes bow in his hand,<br>
    His boltes and arrowes eche one:<br>
  When the sheriffe saw Little John bend his bow,<br>
    He fettled him to be gone.</p>

<p>  Towards his house in Nottingham towne<br>
    He fled full fast away;<br>
  And soe did all his companye:<br>
    Not one behind wold stay.</p>

<p>  But he cold neither runne soe fast,<br>
    Nor away soe fast cold ryde,<br>
  But Litle John with an arrowe soe broad<br>
    He shott him into the 'back'-syde.</p>

<p>  In Carleile dwelt King Arthur,<br>
    A prince of passing might;<br>
  And there maintain'd his table round,<br>
    Beset with many a knight.</p>

<p>  And there he kept his Christmas<br>
    With mirth and princely cheare,<br>
  When, lo! a straunge and cunning boy<br>
    Before him did appeare.</p>

<p>  A kirtle and a mantle<br>
    This boy had him upon,<br>
  With brooches, rings, and owches,<br>
    Full daintily bedone.</p>

<p>  He had a sarke of silk<br>
    About his middle meet;<br>
  And thus, with seemely curtesy,<br>
    He did King Arthur greet.</p>

<p>  "God speed thee, brave King Arthur,<br>
    Thus feasting in thy bowre;<br>
  And Guenever thy goodly queen,<br>
    That fair and peerlesse flowre.</p>

<p>  "Ye gallant lords, and lordings,<br>
    I wish you all take heed,<br>
  Lest, what ye deem a blooming rose,<br>
    Should prove a cankred weed."</p>

<p>  Then straitway from his bosome<br>
    A little wand he drew;<br>
  And with it eke a mantle<br>
    Of wondrous shape and hew.</p>

<p>  "Now have you here, King Arthur,<br>
   Have this here of mee,<br>
  And give unto thy comely queen,<br>
   All-shapen as you see.</p>

<p>  "No wife it shall become,<br>
    That once hath been to blame."<br>
  Then every knight in Arthur's court<br>
    Slye glaunced at his dame.</p>

<p>  And first came Lady Guenever,<br>
    The mantle she must trye.<br>
  This dame, she was new-fangled,<br>
    And of a roving eye.</p>

<p>  When she had tane the mantle,<br>
    And all was with it cladde,<br>
  From top to toe it shiver'd down,<br>
    As tho' with sheers beshradde.</p>

<p>  One while it was too long,<br>
    Another while too short,<br>
  And wrinkled on her shoulders<br>
    In most unseemly sort.</p>

<p>  Now green, now red it seemed,<br>
    Then all of sable hue.<br>
  "Beshrew me," quoth King Arthur,<br>
    "I think thou beest not true."</p>

<p>  Down she threw the mantle,<br>
    Ne longer would not stay;<br>
  But, storming like a fury,<br>
    To her chamber flung away.</p>

<p>  She curst the whoreson weaver,<br>
    That had the mantle wrought:<br>
  And doubly curst the froward impe,<br>
    Who thither had it brought.</p>

<p>  "I had rather live in desarts<br>
    Beneath the green-wood tree;<br>
  Than here, base king, among thy groomes,<br>
    The sport of them and thee."</p>

<p>  Sir Kay call'd forth his lady,<br>
    And bade her to come near:<br>
  "Yet, dame, if thou be guilty,<br>
    I pray thee now forbear."</p>

<p>  This lady, pertly gigling,<br>
    With forward step came on,<br>
  And boldly to the little boy<br>
    With fearless face is gone.</p>

<p>  When she had tane the mantle,<br>
    With purpose for to wear;<br>
  It shrunk up to her shoulder,<br>
    And left her b--- side bare.</p>

<p>  Then every merry knight,<br>
    That was in Arthur's court,<br>
  Gib'd, and laught, and flouted,<br>
    To see that pleasant sport.</p>

<p>  Downe she threw the mantle,<br>
    No longer bold or gay,<br>
  But with a face all pale and wan,<br>
    To her chamber slunk away.</p>

<p>  Then forth came an old knight,<br>
    A pattering o'er his creed;<br>
  And proffer'd to the little boy<br>
    Five nobles to his meed;</p>

<p>  "And all the time of Christmass<br>
    Plumb-porridge shall be thine,<br>
  If thou wilt let my lady fair<br>
    Within the mantle shine."</p>

<p>  A saint his lady seemed,<br>
    With step demure and slow,<br>
  And gravely to the mantle<br>
    With mincing pace doth goe.</p>

<p>  When she the same had taken,<br>
    That was so fine and thin,<br>
  It shrivell'd all about her,<br>
    And show'd her dainty skin.</p>

<p>  Ah! little did HER mincing,<br>
    Or HIS long prayers bestead;<br>
  She had no more hung on her,<br>
    Than a tassel and a thread.</p>

<p>  Down she threwe the mantle,<br>
    With terror and dismay,<br>
  And, with a face of scarlet,<br>
    To her chamber hyed away.</p>

<p>  Sir Cradock call'd his lady,<br>
    And bade her to come neare:<br>
  "Come, win this mantle, lady,<br>
    And do me credit here.</p>

<p>  "Come, win this mantle, lady,<br>
    For now it shall be thine,<br>
  If thou hast never done amiss,<br>
    Sith first I made thee mine."</p>

<p>  The lady, gently blushing,<br>
    With modest grace came on,<br>
  And now to trye the wondrous charm<br>
    Courageously is gone.</p>

<p>  When she had tane the mantle,<br>
    And put it on her backe,<br>
  About the hem it seemed<br>
    To wrinkle and to cracke.</p>

<p>  "Lye still," shee cryed, "O mantle!<br>
    And shame me not for nought,<br>
  I'll freely own whate'er amiss,<br>
    Or blameful I have wrought.</p>

<p>  "Once I kist Sir Cradocke<br>
    Beneathe the green-wood tree:<br>
  Once I kist Sir Cradocke's mouth<br>
    Before he married mee."</p>

<p>  When thus she had her shriven,<br>
    And her worst fault had told,<br>
  The mantle soon became her<br>
    Right comely as it shold.</p>

<p>  Most rich and fair of colour,<br>
    Like gold it glittering shone:<br>
  And much the knights in Arthur's court<br>
    Admir'd her every one.</p>

<p>  Then towards King Arthur's table<br>
    The boy he turn'd his eye:<br>
  Where stood a boar's head garnished<br>
    With bayes and rosemarye.</p>

<p>  When thrice he o'er the boar's head<br>
    His little wand had drawne,<br>
  Quoth he, "There's never a cuckold's knife<br>
    Can carve this head of brawne."</p>

<p>  Then some their whittles rubbed<br>
    On whetstone, and on hone:<br>
  Some threwe them under the table,<br>
    And swore that they had none.</p>

<p>  Sir Cradock had a little knife,<br>
    Of steel and iron made;<br>
  And in an instant thro' the skull<br>
    He thrust the shining blade.</p>

<p>  He thrust the shining blade<br>
    Full easily and fast;<br>
  And every knight in Arthur's court<br>
    A morsel had to taste.</p>

<p>  The boy brought forth a horne,<br>
    All golden was the rim:<br>
  Saith he, "No cuckolde ever can<br>
    Set mouth unto the brim.</p>

<p>  "No cuckold can this little horne<br>
    Lift fairly to his head;<br>
  But or on this, or that side,<br>
    He shall the liquor shed."</p>

<p>  Some shed it on their shoulder,<br>
    Some shed it on their thigh;<br>
  And hee that could not hit his mouth,<br>
    Was sure to hit his eye.</p>

<p>  Thus he, that was a cuckold,<br>
    Was known of every man:<br>
  But Cradock lifted easily,<br>
    And wan the golden can.</p>

<p>  Thus boar's head, horn and mantle,<br>
    Were this fair couple's meed:<br>
  And all such constant lovers,<br>
    God send them well to speed.</p>

<p>  Then down in rage came Guenever,<br>
    And thus could spightful say,<br>
  "Sir Cradock's wife most wrongfully<br>
    Hath borne the prize away.</p>

<p>  "See yonder shameless woman,<br>
    That makes herselfe so clean:<br>
  Yet from her pillow taken<br>
    Thrice five gallants have been.</p>

<p>  "Priests, clarkes, and wedded men,<br>
    Have her lewd pillow prest:<br>
  Yet she the wonderous prize forsooth<br>
    Must beare from all the rest."</p>

<p>  Then bespake the little boy,<br>
    Who had the same in hold:<br>
  "Chastize thy wife, King Arthur,<br>
    Of speech she is too bold:</p>

<p>  "Of speech she is too bold,<br>
    Of carriage all too free;<br>
  Sir King, she hath within thy hall<br>
    A cuckold made of thee.</p>

<p>  "All frolick light and wanton<br>
    She hath her carriage borne:<br>
  And given thee for a kingly crown<br>
    To wear a cuckold's horne."</p>

<br><br>
<h3>PART THE FIRST</h3>

<p>  Lithe and listen, gentlemen,<br>
    To sing a song I will beginne:<br>
  It is of a lord of faire Scotland,<br>
    Which was the unthrifty heire of Linne.</p>

<p>  His father was a right good lord,<br>
    His mother a lady of high degree;<br>
  But they, alas! were dead, him froe,<br>
    And he lov'd keeping companie.</p>

<p>  To spend the daye with merry cheare,<br>
    To drinke and revell every night,<br>
  To card and dice from eve to morne,<br>
    It was, I ween, his hearts delighte.</p>

<p>  To ride, to runne, to rant, to roare,<br>
    To alwaye spend and never spare,<br>
  I wott, an' it were the king himselfe,<br>
    Of gold and fee he mote be bare.</p>

<p>  Soe fares the unthrifty lord of Linne<br>
    Till all his gold is gone and spent;<br>
  And he maun sell his landes so broad,<br>
    His house, and landes, and all his rent.</p>

<p>  His father had a keen stewarde,<br>
    And John o' the Scales was called hee:<br>
  But John is become a gentel-man,<br>
    And John has gott both gold and fee.</p>

<p>  Sayes, Welcome, welcome, lord of Linne,<br>
    Let nought disturb thy merry cheere;<br>
  Iff thou wilt sell thy landes soe broad,<br>
    Good store of gold Ile give thee heere,</p>

<p>  My gold is gone, my money is spent;<br>
    My lande nowe take it unto thee:<br>
  Give me the golde, good John o' the Scales,<br>
    And thine for aye my lande shall bee.</p>

<p>  Then John he did him to record draw,<br>
    And John he cast him a gods-pennie;<br>
  But for every pounde that John agreed,<br>
    The lande, I wis, was well worth three.</p>

<p>  He told him the gold upon the borde,<br>
    He was right glad his land to winne;<br>
  The gold is thine, the land is mine,<br>
    And now Ile be the lord of Linne.</p>

<p>  Thus he hath sold his land soe broad,<br>
    Both hill and holt, and moore and fenne,<br>
  All but a poore and lonesome lodge,<br>
    That stood far off in a lonely glenne.</p>

<p>  For soe he to his father hight.<br>
    My sonne, when I am gonne, sayd hee,<br>
  Then thou wilt spend thy land so broad,<br>
    And thou wilt spend thy gold so free:</p>

<p>  But sweare me nowe upon the roode,<br>
    That lonesome lodge thou'lt never spend;<br>
  For when all the world doth frown on thee,<br>
    Thou there shalt find a faithful friend.</p>

<p>  The heire of Linne is full of golde:<br>
    And come with me, my friends, sayd hee,<br>
  Let's drinke, and rant, and merry make,<br>
    And he that spares, ne'er mote he thee.</p>

<p>  They ranted, drank, and merry made,<br>
    Till all his gold it waxed thinne;<br>
  And then his friendes they slunk away;<br>
    They left the unthrifty heire of Linne.</p>

<p>  He had never a penny in his purse,<br>
    Never a penny left but three,<br>
  And one was brass, another was lead,<br>
    And another it was white money.</p>

<p>  Nowe well-aday, sayd the heire of Linne,<br>
    Nowe well-aday, and woe is mee,<br>
  For when I was the lord of Linne,<br>
    I never wanted gold nor fee.</p>

<p>  But many a trustye friend have I,<br>
    And why shold I feel dole or care?<br>
  Ile borrow of them all by turnes,<br>
    Soe need I not be never bare.</p>

<p>  But one, I wis, was not at home;<br>
    Another had payd his gold away;<br>
  Another call'd him thriftless loone,<br>
    And bade him sharpely wend his way.</p>

<p>  Now well-aday, sayd the heire of Linne,<br>
    Now well-aday, and woe is me;<br>
  For when I had my landes so broad,<br>
    On me they liv'd right merrilee.</p>

<p>  To beg my bread from door to door<br>
    I wis, it were a brenning shame:<br>
  To rob and steale it were a sinne:<br>
    To worke my limbs I cannot frame.</p>

<p>  Now Ile away to lonesome lodge,<br>
    For there my father bade me wend;<br>
  When all the world should frown on mee<br>
    I there shold find a trusty friend.</p>

<br><br>
<h3>PART THE SECOND</h3>

<p>  Away then hyed the heire of Linne<br>
    Oer hill and holt, and moor and fenne,<br>
  Untill he came to lonesome lodge,<br>
    That stood so lowe in a lonely glenne.</p>

<p>  He looked up, he looked downe,<br>
    In hope some comfort for to winne:<br>
  But bare and lothly were the walles.<br>
    Here's sorry cheare, quo' the heire of Linne.</p>

<p>  The little windowe dim and darke<br>
    Was hung with ivy, brere, and yewe;<br>
  No shimmering sunn here ever shone;<br>
    No halesome breeze here ever blew.</p>

<p>  No chair, ne table he mote spye,<br>
    No cheerful hearth, ne welcome bed,<br>
  Nought save a rope with renning noose,<br>
    That dangling hung up o'er his head.</p>

<p>  And over it in broad letters,<br>
    These words were written so plain to see:<br>
  "Ah! gracelesse wretch, hast spent thine all,<br>
    And brought thyselfe to penurie?</p>

<p>  "All this my boding mind misgave,<br>
    I therefore left this trusty friend:<br>
  Let it now sheeld thy foule disgrace,<br>
    And all thy shame and sorrows end."</p>

<p>  Sorely shent wi' this rebuke,<br>
    Sorely shent was the heire of Linne,<br>
  His heart, I wis, was near to brast     With guilt and sorrowe,
shame<br>
and sinne.</p>

<p>  Never a word spake the heire of Linne,<br>
    Never a word he spake but three:<br>
  "This is a trusty friend indeed,<br>
    And is right welcome unto mee."</p>

<p>  Then round his necke the corde he drewe,<br>
    And sprung aloft with his bodie:<br>
  When lo! the ceiling burst in twaine,<br>
    And to the ground came tumbling hee.</p>

<p>  Astonyed lay the heire of Linne,<br>
    Ne knewe if he were live or dead:<br>
  At length he looked, and saw a bille,<br>
    And in it a key of gold so redd.</p>

<p>  He took the bill, and lookt it on,<br>
    Strait good comfort found he there:<br>
  It told him of a hole in the wall,<br>
    In which there stood three chests in-fere.</p>

<p>  Two were full of the beaten golde,<br>
   The third was full of white money;<br>
  And over them in broad letters<br>
   These words were written so plaine to see:</p>

<p>  "Once more, my sonne, I sette thee clere;<br>
   Amend thy life and follies past;<br>
  For but thou amend thee of thy life,<br>
   That rope must be thy end at last."</p>

<p>  And let it bee, sayd the heire of Linne;<br>
   And let it bee, but if I amend:<br>
  For here I will make mine avow,<br>
   This reade shall guide me to the end.</p>

<p>  Away then went with a merry cheare,<br>
   Away then went the heire of Linne;<br>
  I wis, he neither ceas'd ne blanne,<br>
   Till John o' the Scales house he did winne.</p>

<p>  And when he came to John o' the Scales,<br>
   Upp at the speere then looked hee;<br>
  There sate three lords upon a rowe,<br>
   Were drinking of the wine so free.</p>

<p>  And John himself sate at the bord-head,<br>
   Because now lord of Linne was hee.<br>
  I pray thee, he said, good John o' the Scales,<br>
   One forty pence for to lend mee.</p>

<p>  Away, away, thou thriftless loone;<br>
    Away, away, this may not bee:<br>
  For Christs curse on my head, he sayd,<br>
    If ever I trust thee one penn&igrave;e.</p>

<p>  Then bespake the heire of Linne,<br>
    To John o' the Scales wife then spake he:<br>
  Madame, some almes on me bestowe,<br>
    I pray for sweet Saint Charit&igrave;e.</p>

<p>  Away, away, thou thriftless loone,<br>
    I swear thou gettest no almes of mee;<br>
  For if we shold hang any losel heere,<br>
    The first we wold begin with thee.</p>

<p>  Then bespake a good fell&ograve;we,<br>
    Which sat at John o' the Scales his bord<br>
  Sayd, Turn againe, thou heire of Linne;<br>
    Some time thou wast a well good lord;</p>

<p>  Some time a good fellow thou hast been,<br>
    And sparedst not thy gold nor fee;<br>
  Therefore He lend thee forty pence,<br>
    And other forty if need bee.</p>

<p>  And ever, I pray thee, John o' the Scales,<br>
    To let him sit in thy companie:<br>
  For well I wot thou hadst his land,<br>
    And a good bargain it was to thee.</p>

<p>  Up then spake him John o' the Scales,<br>
    All wood he answer'd him againe:<br>
  Now Christs curse on my head, he sayd,<br>
    But I did lose by that barg&agrave;ine.</p>

<p>  And here I proffer thee, heire of Linne,<br>
    Before these lords so faire and free,<br>
  Thou shalt have it backe again better cheape,<br>
    By a hundred markes, than I had it of thee.</p>

<p>  I draw you to record, lords, he said.<br>
    With that he cast him a gods pennie:<br>
  Now by my fay, sayd the heire of Linne,<br>
    And here, good John, is thy mon&egrave;y.</p>

<p>  And he pull'd forth three bagges of gold,<br>
    And layd them down upon the bord:<br>
  All woe begone was John o' the Scales,<br>
    Soe shent he cold say never a word.</p>

<p>  He told him forth the good red gold,<br>
    He told it forth with mickle dinne.<br>
  The gold is thine, the land is mine,<br>
    And now Ime againe the lord of Linne.</p>

<p>  Sayes, Have thou here, thou good fell&ograve;we,<br>
    Forty pence thou didst lend me:<br>
  Now I am againe the lord of Linne,<br>
    And forty pounds I will give thee.</p>

<p>  He make the keeper of my forrest,<br>
    Both of the wild deere and the tame;<br>
  For but I reward thy bounteous heart,<br>
    I wis, good fellowe, I were to blame.</p>

<p>  Now welladay! sayth Joan o' the Scales:<br>
    Now welladay! and woe is my life!<br>
  Yesterday I was lady of Linne,<br>
    Now Ime but John o' the Scales his wife.</p>

<p>  Now fare thee well, sayd the heire of Linne;<br>
    Farewell now, John o' the Scales, said hee:<br>
  Christs curse light on me, if ever again<br>
    I bring my lands in jeopardy.</p>

<p>  I Read that once in Affrica<br>
    A princely wight did raine,<br>
  Who had to name Cophetua,<br>
    As poets they did faine:<br>
  From natures lawes he did decline,<br>
  For sure he was not of my mind.<br>
  He cared not for women-kinde,<br>
    But did them all disdaine.<br>
  But, marke, what hapened on a day,<br>
  As he out of his window lay,<br>
  He saw a beggar all in gray,<br>
    The which did cause his paine.</p>

<p>  The blinded boy, that shootes so trim,<br>
    From heaven downe did hie;<br>
  He drew a dart and shot at him,<br>
    In place where he did lye:<br>
  Which soone did pierse him to the quicke.<br>
  And when he felt the arrow pricke,<br>
  Which in his tender heart did sticke,<br>
    He looketh as he would dye.<br>
  What sudden chance is this, quoth he,<br>
  That I to love must subject be,<br>
  Which never thereto would agree,<br>
    But still did it defie?</p>

<p>  Then from the window he did come,<br>
    And laid him on his bed,<br>
  A thousand heapes of care did runne<br>
    Within his troubled head:<br>
  For now he meanes to crave her love,<br>
  And now he seekes which way to proove<br>
  How he his fancie might remoove,<br>
    And not this beggar wed.<br>
  But Cupid had him so in snare,<br>
  That this poor begger must prepare<br>
  A salve to cure him of his care,<br>
    Or els he would be dead.</p>

<p>  And, as he musing thus did lye,<br>
    He thought for to devise<br>
  How he might have her companye,<br>
    That so did 'maze his eyes.<br>
  In thee, quoth he, doth rest my life;<br>
  For surely thou shalt be my wife,<br>
  Or else this hand with bloody knife<br>
    The Gods shall sure suffice.<br>
  Then from his bed he soon arose,<br>
  And to his pallace gate he goes;<br>
  Full little then this begger knowes<br>
    When she the king espies.</p>

<p>  The Gods preserve your majesty,<br>
    The beggers all gan cry:<br>
  Vouchsafe to give your charity<br>
    Our childrens food to buy.<br>
  The king to them his pursse did cast,<br>
    And they to part it made great haste;<br>
  This silly woman was the last<br>
    That after them did hye.<br>
  The king he cal'd her back againe,<br>
  And unto her he gave his chaine;<br>
  And said, With us you shal remaine<br>
    Till such time as we dye:</p>

<p>  For thou, quoth he, shalt be my wife,<br>
    And honoured for my queene;<br>
  With thee I meane to lead my life,<br>
    As shortly shall be seene:<br>
  Our wedding shall appointed be,<br>
  And every thing in its degree:<br>
  Come on, quoth he, and follow me,<br>
    Thou shalt go shift thee cleane.<br>
  What is thy name, faire maid? quoth he.<br>
  Penelophon, O king, quoth she;<br>
  With that she made a lowe courtsey;<br>
    A trim one as I weene.</p>

<p>  Thus hand in hand along they walke<br>
    Unto the king's pallace:<br>
  The king with curteous comly talke<br>
    This beggar doth imbrace:<br>
  The begger blusheth scarlet red,<br>
  And straight againe as pale as lead,<br>
  But not a word at all she said,<br>
    She was in such amaze.<br>
  At last she spake with trembling voyce,<br>
  And said, O king, I doe rejoyce<br>
  That you wil take me from your choyce,<br>
    And my degree's so base.</p>

<p>  And when the wedding day was come,<br>
    The king commanded strait<br>
  The noblemen both all and some<br>
    Upon the queene to wait.<br>
  And she behaved herself that day,<br>
  As if she had never walkt the way;<br>
  She had forgot her gown of gray,<br>
    Which she did weare of late.<br>
  The proverbe old is come to passe,<br>
  The priest, when he begins his masse,<br>
  Forgets that ever clerke he was;<br>
    He knowth not his estate.</p>

<p>  Here you may read, Cophetua,<br>
    Though long time fancie-fed,<br>
  Compelled by the blinded boy<br>
    The begger for to wed:<br>
  He that did lovers lookes disdaine,<br>
  To do the same was glad and faine,<br>
  Or else he would himselfe have slaine,<br>
  In storie, as we read.<br>
    Disdaine no whit, O lady deere,<br>
    But pitty now thy servant heere,<br>
    Least that it hap to thee this yeare,<br>
      As to that king it did.</p>

<p>  And thus they led a quiet life<br>
    Duringe their princely raigne;<br>
  And in a tombe were buried both,<br>
    As writers sheweth plaine.<br>
  The lords they tooke it grievously,<br>
  The ladies tooke it heavily,<br>
  The commons cryed pitiously,<br>
    Their death to them was paine,<br>
    Their fame did sound so passingly,<br>
    That it did pierce the starry sky,<br>
    And throughout all the world did flye<br>
      To every princes realme.</p>

  If it please your grace to give me leave,<br>
    Myselfe wil be the only man.</p>

<p>  Thou art but yong; the kyng replyed:<br>
    Yond Scott hath numbered manye a yeare.<br>
  "Trust me, my liege, lie make him quail,<br>
    Or before my prince I will never appeare."<br>
  Then bowemen and gunners thou shalt have,<br>
    And chuse them over my realme so free;<br>
  Besides good mariners, and shipp-boyes,<br>
    To guide the great shipp on the sea.</p>

<p>  The first man, that Lord Howard chose,<br>
    Was the ablest gunner in all the realm,<br>
  Thoughe he was three score yeeres and ten;<br>
    Good Peter Simon was his name.<br>
  Peter, sais hee, I must to the sea,<br>
    To bring home a traytor live or dead:<br>
  Before all others I have chosen thee;<br>
    Of a hundred gunners to be the head.</p>

<p>  If you, my lord, have chosen mee<br>
    Of a hundred gunners to be the head,<br>
  Then hang me up on your maine-mast tree,<br>
    If I misse my marke one shilling bread.<br>
  My lord then chose a boweman rare,<br>
    "Whose active hands had gained fame."<br>
  In Yorkshire was this gentleman borne,<br>
    And William Horseley was his name.</p>

<p>  Horseley, said he, I must with speede<br>
    Go seeke a traytor on the sea,<br>
  And now of a hundred bowemen brave<br>
    To be the head I have chosen thee.<br>
  If you, quoth hee, have chosen mee<br>
    Of a hundred bowemen to be the head<br>
  On your main-mast He hanged bee,<br>
    If I miss twelvescore one penny bread.</p>

<p>  With pikes and gunnes, and bowemen bold,<br>
    This noble Howard is gone to the sea;<br>
  With a valyant heart and a pleasant cheare,<br>
    Out at Thames mouth sayled he.<br>
  And days he scant had sayled three,<br>
    Upon the 'voyage,' he tooke in hand,<br>
  But there he mett with a noble shipp,<br>
    And stoutely made itt stay and stand.</p>

<p>  Thou must tell me, Lord Howard said,<br>
    Now who thou art, and what's thy name;<br>
  And shewe me where they dwelling is:<br>
    And whither bound, and whence thou came.<br>
  My name is Henry Hunt, quoth hee<br>
    With a heavye heart, and a carefull mind;<br>
  I and my shipp doe both belong<br>
    To the Newcastle, that stands upon Tyne.</p>

<p>  Hast thou not heard, nowe, Henrye Hunt,<br>
    As thou hast sayled by daye and by night,<br>
  Of a Scottish rover on the seas;<br>
    Men call him Sir Andrew Barton, knight!<br>
  Then ever he sighed, and said alas!<br>
    With a grieved mind, and well away!<br>
  But over-well I knowe that wight,<br>
    I was his prisoner yesterday.</p>

<p>  As I was sayling uppon the sea,<br>
    A Burdeaux voyage for to fare;<br>
  To his hach-borde he clasped me,<br>
    And robd me of all my merchant ware:<br>
  And mickle debts, God wot, I owe,<br>
    And every man will have his owne;<br>
  And I am nowe to London bounde,<br>
    Of our gracious king to beg a boone.</p>

<p>  That shall not need, Lord Howard sais;<br>
    Lett me but once that robber see,<br>
  For every penny tane thee froe<br>
    It shall be doubled shillings three.<br>
  Nowe God forefend, the merchant said,<br>
    That you should seek soe far amisse!<br>
  God keepe you out of that traitors hands!<br>
    Full litle ye wott what a man hee is.</p>

<p>  Hee is brasse within, and steele without,<br>
    With beames on his topcastle stronge;<br>
  And eighteen pieces of ordinance<br>
    He carries on each side along:<br>
  And he hath a pinnace deerlye dight,<br>
    St. Andrewes crosse that is his guide;<br>
  His pinnace beareth ninescore men,<br>
    And fifteen canons on each side.</p>

<p>  Were ye twentye shippes, and he but one;<br>
    I sweare by kirke, and bower, and hall;<br>
  He wold overcome them everye one,<br>
    If once his beames they doe downe fall.<br>
  This is cold comfort, sais my lord,<br>
    To wellcome a stranger thus to the sea:<br>
  Yet He bring him and his ship to shore,<br>
    Or to Scottland hee shall carrye mee.</p>

<p>  Then a noble gunner you must have,<br>
    And he must aim well with his ee,<br>
  And sinke his pinnace into the sea,<br>
    Or else hee never orecome will bee:<br>
  And if you chance his shipp to borde,<br>
    This counsel I must give withall,<br>
  Let no man to his topcastle goe<br>
    To strive to let his beams downe fall.</p>

<p>  And seven pieces of ordinance,<br>
    I pray your honour lend to mee,<br>
  On each side of my shipp along,<br>
    And I will lead you on the sea.<br>
  A glasse He sett, that may be seene<br>
    Whether you sail by day or night;<br>
  And to-morrowe, I sweare, by nine of the clocke<br>
    You shall meet with Sir Andrewe Barton knight.</p>

<p>  THE SECOND PART</p>

<p>  The merchant sett my lorde a glasse<br>
    Soe well apparent in his sight,<br>
  And on the morrowe, by nine of the clocke,<br>
    He shewed him Sir Andrewe Barton knight.<br>
  His hachebord it was 'gilt' with gold,<br>
    Soe deerlye dight it dazzled the ee:<br>
  Nowe by my faith, Lord Howarde sais,<br>
    This is a gallant sight to see.</p>

<p>  Take in your ancyents, standards eke,<br>
    So close that no man may them see;<br>
  And put me forth a white willowe wand,<br>
    As merchants use to sayle the sea.<br>
  But they stirred neither top, nor mast;<br>
    Stoutly they past Sir Andrew by.<br>
  What English churles are yonder, he sayd,<br>
    That can soe little curtesye?</p>

<p>  Now by the roode, three yeares and more<br>
    I have beene admirall over the sea;<br>
  And never an English nor Portingall<br>
    Without my leave can passe this way.<br>
  Then called he forth his stout pinnace;<br>
    "Fetch backe yond pedlars nowe to mee:<br>
  I sweare by the masse, yon English churles<br>
    Shall all hang att my maine-mast tree."</p>

<p>  With that the pinnace itt shot off,<br>
    Full well Lord Howard might it ken;<br>
  For itt stroke down my lord's fore mast,<br>
    And killed fourteen of his men.<br>
  Come hither, Simon, sayes my lord,<br>
    Looke that thy word be true, thou said;<br>
  For at my maine-mast thou shalt hang,<br>
    If thou misse thy marke one shilling bread.</p>

<p>  Simon was old, but his heart itt was bold;<br>
    His ordinance he laid right lowe;<br>
  He put in chaine full nine yardes long,<br>
    With other great shott lesse, and moe;<br>
  And he lette goe his great gunnes shott:<br>
    Soe well he settled itt with his ee,<br>
  The first sight that Sir Andrew sawe,<br>
    He see his pinnace sunke in the sea.</p>

<p>  And when he saw his pinnace sunke,<br>
    Lord, how his heart with rage did swell!<br>
  "Nowe cutt my ropes, itt is time to be gon;<br>
    Ile fetch yond pedlars backe mysell."<br>
  When my lord sawe Sir Andrewe loose,<br>
    Within his heart he was full faine:<br>
  "Now spread your ancyents, strike up your drummes,<br>
    Sound all your trumpetts out amaine."</p>

<p>  Fight on, my men, Sir Andrewe sais,<br>
    Weale howsoever this geere will sway;<br>
  Itt is my Lord Admirall of England,<br>
    Is come to seeke mee on the sea.<br>
  Simon had a sonne, who shott right well,<br>
    That did Sir Andrewe mickle scare;<br>
  In att his decke he gave a shott,<br>
    Killed threescore of his men of warre.</p>

<p>  Then Henrye Hunt with rigour hott<br>
    Came bravely on the other side,<br>
  Soone he drove downe his fore-mast tree,<br>
    And killed fourscore men beside.<br>
  Nowe, out alas! Sir Andrewe cryed,<br>
    What may a man now thinke, or say?<br>
  Yonder merchant theefe, that pierceth mee,<br>
    He was my prisoner yesterday.</p>

<p>  Come hither to me, thou Gordon good,<br>
    That aye wast readye att my call:<br>
  I will give thee three hundred markes,<br>
    If thou wilt let my beames downe fall.<br>
  Lord Howard hee then calld in haste,<br>
    "Horseley see thou be true in stead;<br>
  For thou shalt at the maine-mast hang,<br>
    If thou misse twelvescore one penny bread."</p>

<p>  Then Gordon swarved the maine-mast tree,<br>
    He swarved it with might and maine;<br>
  But Horseley with a bearing arrowe,<br>
    Stroke the Gordon through the braine;<br>
  And he fell unto the haches again,<br>
    And sore his deadlye wounde did bleed:<br>
  Then word went through Sir Andrews men,<br>
    How that the Gordon hee was dead.</p>

<p>  Come hither to mee, James Hambilton,<br>
    Thou art my only sisters sonne,<br>
  If thou wilt let my beames downe fall<br>
    Six hundred nobles thou hast wonne.<br>
  With that he swarved the maine-mast tree,<br>
    He swarved it with nimble art;<br>
  But Horseley with a broad arr&ograve;we<br>
    Pierced the Hambilton thorough the heart:</p>

<p>  And downe he fell upon the deck,<br>
    That with his blood did streame amaine:<br>
  Then every Scott cryed, Well-away!<br>
    Alas! a comelye youth is slaine.<br>
  All woe begone was Sir Andrew then,<br>
    With griefe and rage his heart did swell:<br>
  "Go fetch me forth my armour of proofe,<br>
    For I will to the topcastle mysell."</p>

<p>  "Goe fetch me forth my armour of proofe;<br>
    That gilded is with gold soe cleare:<br>
  God be with my brother John of Barton!<br>
    Against the Portingalls hee it ware;<br>
  And when he had on this armour of proofe,<br>
    He was a gallant sight to see:<br>
  Ah! nere didst thou meet with living wight,<br>
    My deere brother, could cope with thee."</p>

<p>  Come hither Horseley, sayes my lord,<br>
    And looke your shaft that itt goe right,<br>
  Shoot a good shoote in time of need,<br>
    And for it thou shalt be made a knight.<br>
  Ile shoot my best, quoth Horseley then,<br>
    Your honour shall see, with might and maine;<br>
  But if I were hanged at your maine-mast,<br>
    I have now left but arrowes twaine.</p>

<p>  Sir Andrew he did swarve the tree,<br>
   With right good will he swarved then:<br>
  Upon his breast did Horseley hitt,<br>
    But the arrow bounded back agen.<br>
  Then Horseley spyed a privye place<br>
    With a perfect eye in a secrette part;<br>
  Under the spole of his right arme<br>
    He smote Sir Andrew to the heart.</p>

<p>  "Fight on, my men," Sir Andrew sayes,<br>
    "A little Ime hurt, but yett not slaine;<br>
  He but lye downe and bleede a while,<br>
    And then He rise and fight againe.<br>
  Fight on, my men," Sir Andrew sayes,<br>
    "And never flinch before the foe;<br>
  And stand fast by St. Andrewes crosse<br>
    Until you heare my whistle blowe."</p>

<p>  They never heard his whistle blow--<br>
    Which made their hearts waxe sore adread:<br>
  Then Horseley sayd, Aboard, my lord,<br>
    For well I wott Sir Andrew's dead.<br>
  They boarded then his noble shipp,<br>
    They boarded it with might and maine;<br>
  Eighteen score Scots alive they found,<br>
    The rest were either maimed or slaine.</p>

<p>  Lord Howard tooke a sword in hand,<br>
    And off he smote Sir Andrewes head,<br>
  "I must have left England many a daye,<br>
    If thou wert alive as thou art dead."<br>
  He caused his body to be cast<br>
    Over the hatchboard into the sea,<br>
  And about his middle three hundred crownes:<br>
    "Wherever thou land this will bury thee."</p>

<p>  Thus from the warres Lord Howard came,<br>
    And backe he sayled ore the maine,<br>
  With mickle joy and triumphing<br>
    Into Thames mouth he came againe.<br>
  Lord Howard then a letter wrote,<br>
    And sealed it with scale and ring;<br>
  "Such a noble prize have I brought to your grace,<br>
    As never did subject to a king:</p>

<p>  "Sir Andrewes shipp I bring with mee;<br>
    A braver shipp was never none:<br>
  Nowe hath your grace two shipps of warr,<br>
    Before in England was but one."<br>
  King Henryes grace with royall cheere<br>
    Welcomed the noble Howard home,<br>
  And where, said he, is this rover stout,<br>
   That I myselfe may give the doome?</p>

<p>  "The rover, he is safe, my liege,<br>
    Full many a fadom in the sea;<br>
  If he were alive as he is dead,<br>
    I must have left England many a day:<br>
  And your grace may thank four men i' the ship<br>
    For the victory wee have wonne,<br>
  These are William Horseley, Henry Hunt,<br>
    And Peter Simon, and his sonne."</p>

<p>  To Henry Hunt, the king then sayd,<br>
    In lieu of what was from thee tane,<br>
  A noble a day now thou shalt have,<br>
    Sir Andrewes jewels and his chayne.<br>
  And Horseley thou shalt be a knight,<br>
    And lands and livings shalt have store;<br>
  Howard shall be erle Surrye hight,<br>
    As Howards erst have beene before.</p>

<p>  Nowe, Peter Simon, thou art old,<br>
    I will maintaine thee and thy sonne:<br>
  And the men shall have five hundred markes<br>
    For the good service they have done.<br>
  Then in came the queene with ladyes fair<br>
    To see Sir Andrewe Barton knight:<br>
  They weend that hee were brought on shore,<br>
    And thought to have seen a gallant sight.</p>

<p>  But when they see his deadlye face,<br>
    And eyes soe hollow in his head,<br>
  I wold give, quoth the king, a thousand markes,<br>
    This man were alive as hee is dead:<br>
  Yett for the manfull part hee playd,<br>
    Which fought soe well with heart and hand,<br>
  His men shall have twelvepence a day,<br>
    Till they come to my brother kings high land.</p>

<h3>PART THE FIRST</h3>

<p>  Itt was a blind beggar, had long lost his sight,<br>
  He had a faire daughter of bewty most bright;<br>
  And many a gallant brave suiter had shee,<br>
  For none was soe comelye as pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  And though shee was of favour most faire,<br>
  Yett seeing shee was but a poor beggars heyre,<br>
  Of ancyent housekeepers despised was shee,<br>
  Whose sonnes came as suitors to prettye Bessee.</p>

<p>  Wherefore in great sorrow faire Bessy did say,<br>
  Good father, and mother, let me goe away<br>
  To seeke out my fortune, whatever itt bee.<br>
  This suite then they granted to prettye Bessee.</p>

<p>  Then Bessy, that was of bewtye soe bright,<br>
  All cladd in gray russett, and late in the night<br>
  From father and mother alone parted shee;<br>
  Who sighed and sobbed for prettye Bessee.</p>

<p>  Shee went till shee came to Stratford-le-Bow;<br>
  Then knew shee not whither, nor which way to goe:<br>
  With teares shee lamented her hard destinie,<br>
  So sadd and soe heavy was pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  Shee kept on her journey untill it was day,<br>
  And went unto Rumford along the hye way;<br>
  Where at the Queenes armes entertained was shee;<br>
  Soe faire and wel favoured was pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  Shee had not beene there a month to an end,<br>
  But master and mistress and all was her friend:<br>
  And every brave gallant, that once did her see,<br>
  Was straight-way enamoured of pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  Great gifts they did send her of silver and gold,<br>
  And in their songs daylye her love was extold;<br>
  Her beawtye was blazed in every degree;<br>
  Soe faire and soe comelye was pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  The young men of Rumford in her had their joy;<br>
  Shee shewed herself curteous, and modestlye coye;<br>
  And at her commandment still wold they bee;<br>
  Soe fayre and soe comlye was pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  Foure suitors att once unto her did goe;<br>
  They craved her favor, but still she sayd noe;<br>
  I wold not wish gentles to marry with mee.<br>
  Yett ever they honored prettye Bessee.</p>

<p>  The first of them was a gallant young knight,<br>
  And he came unto her disguisde in the night;<br>
  The second a gentleman of good degree,<br>
  Who wooed and sued for prettye Bessee.</p>

<p>  A merchant of London, whose wealth was not small,<br>
  He was the third suiter, and proper withall:<br>
  Her masters own sonne the fourth man must bee,<br>
  Who swore he would dye for pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  And, if thou wilt marry with mee, quoth the knight,<br>
  Ile make thee a ladye with joy and delight;<br>
  My hart's so inthralled by thy bewtle,<br>
  That soone I shall dye for prettye Bessee.</p>

<p>  The gentleman sayd, Come, marry with mee,<br>
  As fine as a ladye my Bessy shal bee:<br>
  My life is distressed: O heare me, quoth hee;<br>
  And grant me thy love, my prettye Bessee.</p>

<p>  Let me bee thy husband, the merchant cold say,<br>
  Thou shalt live in London both gallant and gay;<br>
  My shippes shall bring home rych jewells for thee,<br>
  And I will for ever love pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  Then Bessy shee sighed, and thus she did say,<br>
  My father and mother I meane to obey;<br>
  First gett their good will, and be faithfull to mee,<br>
  And you shall enjoye your prettye Bessee.</p>

<p>  To every one this answer shee made,<br>
  Wherfore unto her they joyfullye sayd,<br>
  This thing to fulfill wee all doe agree;  But where dwells thy
father,<br>
my prettye Besse?</p>

<p>  My father, shee said, is soone to be seene:<br>
  The seely blind beggar of Bednall-greene,<br>
  That daylye sits begging for charitie,<br>
  He is the good father of pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  His markes and his tokens are knowen very well;<br>
  He alwayes is led with a dogg and a bell:<br>
  A seely olde man, God knoweth, is hee,<br>
  Yett hee is the father of pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  Nay then, quoth the merchant, thou art not for mee:<br>
  Nor, quoth the innholder, my wiffe thou shalt bee:<br>
  I lothe, sayd the gentle, a beggars degree,<br>
  And therefore, adewe, my pretty Bessee!</p>

<p>  Why then, quoth the knight, hap better or worse,<br>
  I waighe not true love by the waight of my pursse,<br>
  And bewtye is bewtye in every degree;<br>
  Then welcome unto me, my prettye Bessee.</p>

<p>  With thee to thy father forthwith I will goe.<br>
  Nay soft, quoth his kinsmen, it must not be soe;<br>
  A poor beggars daughter noe ladye shal bee,<br>
  Then take thy adew of pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  But soone after this, by breake of the day,<br>
  The knight had from Rumford stole Bessy away.<br>
  The younge men of Rumford, as thicke might bee,<br>
  Rode after to feitch againe pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  As swifte as the winde to ryde they were scene,<br>
  Untill they came neare unto Bednall-greene;<br>
  And as the knight lighted most courteousl&igrave;e,<br>
  They all fought against him for pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  But rescew came speedilye over the plaine,<br>
  Or else the young knight for his love had been slaine.<br>
  This fray being ended, then straitway he see<br>
  His kinsmen come rayling at pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  Then spake the blind beggar, Although I bee poore,<br>
  Yett rayle not against my child at my own doore:<br>
  Though shee be not decked in velvett and pearle,<br>
  Yett will I dropp angells with you for my girle.</p>

<p>  And then, if my gold may better her birthe,<br>
  And equall the gold that you lay on the earth,<br>

  All the discourse therof you did see;<br>
  But now comes the wedding of pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  Within a gorgeous palace most brave,<br>
  Adorned with all the cost they cold have,<br>
  This wedding was kept most sumptuousl&igrave;e,<br>
  And all for the credit of pretty Bessee.</p>

  Were bought for the banquet, as it was most meete;<br>
  Partridge, and plover, and venison most free,<br>
  Against the brave wedding of pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  This marriage through England was spread by report,<br>
  Soe that a great number therto did resort<br>
  Of nobles and gentles in every degree;<br>
  And all for the fame of prettye Bessee.</p>

<p>  To church then went this gallant younge knight;<br>
  His bride followed after, an angell most bright,<br>
  With troopes of ladyes, the like nere was scene<br>
  As went with sweete Bessy of Bednall-greene.</p>

<p>  This marryage being solempnized then,<br>
  With musicke performed by the skilfullest men,<br>
  The nobles and gentles sate downe at that tyde,<br>
  Each one admiring the beautiful bryde.</p>

<p>  Now, after the sumptuous dinner was done,<br>
  To talke, and to reason a number begunn:<br>
  They talkt of the blind beggars daughter most bright,<br>
  And what with his daughter he gave to the knight.</p>

<p>  Then spake the nobles, "Much marveil have wee,<br>
  This jolly blind beggar wee cannot here see."<br>
  My lords, quoth the bride, my father's so base,<br>
  He is loth with his presence these states to disgrace.</p>

<p>  "The prayse of a woman in question to bringe<br>
  Before her own face, were a flattering thinge;<br>
  But wee thinke thy father's baseness," quoth they,<br>
  "Might by thy bewtye be cleane put awaye."</p>

<p>  They had noe sooner these pleasant words spoke,<br>
  But in comes the beggar cladd in a silke cloke;<br>
  A faire velvet capp, and a fether had hee,<br>
  And now a musicyan forsooth he wold bee.</p>

<p>  He had a daintye lute under his arme,<br>
  He touched the strings, which made such a charme,<br>
  Saies, Please you to heare any musicke of mee,<br>
  Ile sing you a song of pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  With that his lute he twanged straightway,<br>
  And thereon begann most sweetlye to play;<br>
  And after that lessons were playd two or three,<br>
  He strayn'd out this song most delicatel&igrave;e.</p>

<p>  "A poore beggars daughter did dwell on a greene,<br>
  Who for her fairenesse might well be a queene:<br>
  A blithe bonny lasse, and a daintye was shee,<br>
  And many one called her pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  "Her father hee had noe goods, nor noe land,<br>
  But begged for a penny all day with his hand;<br>
  And yett to her marriage he gave thousands three,<br>
  And still he hath somewhat for pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  "And if any one here her birth doe disdaine,<br>
  Her father is ready, with might and with maine,<br>
  To proove shee is come of noble degree:<br>
  Therfore never flout att prettye Bessee."</p>

<p>  With that the lords and the companye round<br>
  With harty laughter were readye to swound;<br>
  Att last said the lords, Full well wee may see,<br>
  The bride and the beggar's behoulden to thee.</p>

<p>  On this the bride all blushing did rise,<br>
  The pearlie dropps standing within her faire eyes,<br>
  O pardon my father, grave nobles, quoth shee,<br>
  That throughe blind affection thus doteth on mee.</p>

<p>  If this be thy father, the nobles did say,<br>
  Well may he be proud of this happy day;<br>
  Yett by his countenance well may wee see,<br>
  His birth and his fortune did never agree:</p>

<p>  And therefore, blind man, we pray thee bewray,<br>
  (and looke that the truth thou to us doe say)<br>
  Thy birth and thy parentage, whatt itt may bee;<br>
  For the love that thou bearest to pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  "Then give me leave, nobles and gentles, each one,<br>
  One song more to sing, and then I have done;<br>
  And if that itt may not winn good report,<br>
  Then doe not give me a GROAT for my sport.</p>

<p>  "Sir Simon de Montfort my subject shal bee;<br>
  Once chiefe of all the great barons was hee,<br>
  Yet fortune so cruelle this lorde did abase,<br>
  Now loste and forgotten are hee and his race.</p>

<p>  "When the barons in armes did King Henrye oppose,<br>
  Sir Simon de Montfort their leader they chose;<br>
  A leader of courage undaunted was hee,<br>
  And oft-times he made their enemyes flee.</p>

<p>  "At length in the battle on Eveshame plaine<br>
  The barons were routed, and Montford was slaine;<br>
  Moste fatall that battel did prove unto thee,<br>
  Thoughe thou wast not borne then, my prettye Bessee!</p>

<p>  "Along with the nobles, that fell at that tyde,<br>
  His eldest son Henrye, who fought by his side,<br>
  Was fellde by a blowe, he receivde in the fight!<br>
  A blowe that deprivde him for ever of sight.</p>

<p>  "Among the dead bodyes all lifeless he laye,<br>
  Till evening drewe on of the following daye,<br>
  When by a yong ladye discovered was hee;<br>
  And this was thy mother, my prettye Bessee!</p>

<p>  "A barons faire daughter stept forth in the nighte<br>
  To search for her father, who fell in the fight,<br>
  And seeing young Montfort, where gasping he laye,<br>
  Was moved with pitye, and brought him awaye.</p>

<p>  "In secrette she nurst him, and swaged his paine,<br>
  While he throughe the realme was beleeved to be slaine<br>
  At lengthe his faire bride she consented to bee,<br>
  And made him glad father of prettye Bessee.</p>

<p>  "And nowe lest oure foes our lives sholde betraye,<br>
  We clothed ourselves in beggars arraye;<br>
  Her jewelles shee solde, and hither came wee:<br>
  All our comfort and care was our prettye Bessee.</p>

<p>  "And here have we lived in fortunes despite,<br>
  Thoughe poore, yet contented with humble delighte:<br>
  Full forty winters thus have I beene<br>
  A silly blind beggar of Bednall-greene.</p>

<p>  "And here, noble lordes, is ended the song<br>
  Of one, that once to your own ranke did belong:<br>
  And thus have you learned a secrette from mee,<br>
  That ne'er had been knowne, but for prettye Bessee."</p>

<p>  Now when the faire companye everye one,<br>
  Had heard the strange tale in the song he had showne,<br>
  They all were amazed, as well they might bee,<br>
  Both at the blinde beggar, and pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>  With that the faire bride they all did embrace,<br>
  Saying, Sure thou art come of an honourable race,<br>
  Thy father likewise is of noble degree,<br>
  And thou art well worthy a lady to bee.</p>

<p>  Thus was the feast ended with joye and delighte,<br>
  A bridegroome most happy then was the younge knighte,<br>
  In joy and felicitie long lived hee,<br>
  All with his faire ladye, the pretty Bessee.</p>

<br><br>

<p>  The fifteenth day of July,<br>
    With glistering spear and shield,<br>
  A famous fight in Flanders<br>
    Was foughten in the field:<br>
  The most couragious officers<br>
    Were English captains three;<br>
  But the bravest man in battel<br>
    Was brave Lord Willoughb&egrave;y.</p>

<p>  The next was Captain Norris,<br>
    A valiant man was hee:<br>
  The other Captain Turner,<br>
    From field would never flee.<br>
  With fifteen hundred fighting men,<br>
    Alas! there were no more,<br>
  They fought with fourteen thousand then,<br>
    Upon the bloody shore.</p>

<p>  Stand to it, noble pikemen,<br>
    And look you round about:<br>
  And shoot you right, you bow-men,<br>
    And we will keep them out:<br>
  You musquet and call&igrave;ver men,<br>
    Do you prove true to me,<br>
  I'le be the formost man in fight,<br>
    Says brave Lord Willoughb&egrave;y.</p>

<p>  And then the bloody enemy<br>
    They fiercely did assail,<br>
  And fought it out most furiously,<br>
    Not doubting to prevail:<br>
  The wounded men on both sides fell<br>
    Most pitious for to see,<br>
  Yet nothing could the courage quell<br>
    Of brave Lord Willoughb&egrave;y.</p>

<p>  For seven hours to all mens view<br>
    This fight endured sore,<br>
  Until our men so feeble grew<br>
    That they could fight no more;<br>
  And then upon dead horses<br>
    Full savourly they eat,<br>
  And drank the puddle water,<br>
    They could no better get.</p>

<p>  When they had fed so freely,<br>
    They kneeled on the ground,<br>
  And praised God devoutly<br>
    For the favour they had found;<br>
  And beating up their colours,<br>
    The fight they did renew,<br>
  And turning tow'rds the Spaniard,<br>
    A thousand more they slew.</p>

<p>  The sharp steel-pointed arrows,<br>
    And bullets thick did fly,<br>
  Then did our valiant soldiers<br>
    Charge on most furiously;<br>
  Which made the Spaniards waver,<br>
    They thought it best to flee,<br>
  They fear'd the stout behaviour<br>
    Of brave Lord Willoughbey.</p>

<p>  Then quoth the Spanish general,<br>
    Come let us march away,<br>
  I fear we shall be spoiled all<br>
    If here we longer stay;<br>
  For yonder comes Lord Willoughbey<br>
    With courage fierce and fell,<br>
  He will not give one inch of way<br>
    For all the devils in hell.</p>

<p>  And then the fearful enemy<br>
    Was quickly put to flight,<br>
  Our men persued couragiously,<br>
    And caught their forces quite;<br>
  But at last they gave a shout,<br>
    Which ecchoed through the sky,<br>
  God, and St. George for England!<br>
    The conquerors did cry.</p>

<p>  This news was brought to England<br>
    With all the speed might be,<br>
  And soon our gracious queen was told<br>
    Of this same victory.<br>
  O this is brave Lord Willoughbey,<br>
    My love that ever won,<br>
  Of all the lords of honour<br>
    'Tis he great deeds hath done.</p>

<p>  To the souldiers that were maimed,<br>
    And wounded in the fray,<br>
  The queen allowed a pension<br>
    Of fifteen pence a day;<br>
  And from all costs and charges<br>
    She quit and set them free:<br>
  And this she did all for the sake<br>
    Of brave Lord Willoughbey.</p>

<p>  Then courage, noble Englishmen,<br>
    And never be dismaid;<br>
  If that we be but one to ten,<br>
    We will not be afraid<br>
  To fight with foraign enemies,<br>
    And set our nation free.<br>

  Of fair lovers there is plenty,<br>
    Spain doth yield a wonderous store."<br>
  Spaniards fraught with jealousy we often find,<br>
  But Englishmen through all the world are counted kind.</p>

<p>  Leave me not unto a Spaniard,<br>
    You alone enjoy my heart:<br>
  I am lovely, young, and tender,<br>

<br><br>

<p>  It was a friar of orders gray<br>
   Walkt forth to tell his beades;<br>
  And he met with a lady faire,<br>
    Clad in a pilgrime's weedes.</p>

<p>  Now Christ thee save, thou reverend friar,<br>
    I pray thee tell to me,<br>
  If ever at yon holy shrine<br>
    My true love thou didst see.</p>

<p>  And how should I know your true love<br>
    From many another one?<br>
  O by his cockle hat, and staff,<br>
    And by his sandal shoone.</p>

<p>  But chiefly by his face and mien,<br>
    That were so fair to view;<br>
  His flaxen locks that sweetly curl'd,<br>
    And eyne of lovely blue.</p>

<p>  O lady, he is dead and gone!<br>
    Lady, he's dead and gone!<br>
  And at his head a green grass turfe,<br>
    And at his heels a stone.</p>

<p>  Within these holy cloysters long<br>
    He languisht, and he dyed,<br>
  Lamenting of a ladyes love,<br>
    And 'playning of her pride.</p>

<p>  Here bore him barefac'd on his bier<br>
    Six proper youths and tall,<br>
  And many a tear bedew'd his grave<br>
    Within yon kirk-yard wall.</p>

<p>  And art thou dead, thou gentle youth!<br>
    And art thou dead and gone!<br>
  And didst thou die for love of me!<br>
    Break, cruel heart of stone!</p>

<p>  O weep not, lady, weep not soe;<br>
    Some ghostly comfort seek:<br>
  Let not vain sorrow rive thy heart,<br>
    Ne teares bedew thy cheek.</p>

<p>  O do not, do not, holy friar,<br>
    My sorrow now reprove;<br>
  For I have lost the sweetest youth,<br>
    That e'er wan ladyes love.</p>

<p>  And nowe, alas! for thy sad losse,<br>
    I'll evermore weep and sigh;<br>
  For thee I only wisht to live,<br>
    For thee I wish to dye.</p>

<p>  Weep no more, lady, weep no more,<br>
    Thy sorrowe is in vaine:<br>
  For violets pluckt the sweetest showers<br>
    Will ne'er make grow againe.</p>

<p>  Our joys as winged dreams doe flye,<br>
    Why then should sorrow last?<br>
  Since grief but aggravates thy losse,<br>
    Grieve not for what is past.</p>

<p>  O say not soe, thou holy friar;<br>
    I pray thee, say not soe:<br>
  For since my true-love dyed for mee,<br>
    'Tis meet my tears should flow.</p>

<p>  And will he ne'er come again?<br>
    Will he ne'er come again?<br>
  Ah! no, he is dead and laid in his grave,<br>
    For ever to remain.</p>

<p>  His cheek was redder than the rose;<br>
    The comliest youth was he!<br>
  But he is dead and laid in his grave:<br>
    Alas, and woe is me!</p>

<p>  Sigh no more, lady, sigh no more,<br>
    Men were deceivers ever:<br>
  One foot on sea and one on land,<br>
    To one thing constant never.</p>

<p>  Hadst thou been fond, he had been false,<br>
    And left thee sad and heavy;<br>
  For young men ever were fickle found,<br>
    Since summer trees were leafy.</p>

<p>  Now say not so, thou holy friar,<br>
    I pray thee say not soe;<br>
  My love he had the truest heart:<br>
    O he was ever true!</p>

<p>  And art thou dead, thou much-lov'd youth,<br>
    And didst thou dye for mee?<br>
  Then farewell home; for ever-more<br>
    A pilgrim I will bee.</p>

<p>  But first upon my true-loves grave<br>
    My weary limbs I'll lay,<br>
  And thrice I'll kiss the green-grass turf,<br>
    That wraps his breathless clay.</p>

<p>  Yet stay, fair lady; rest awhile<br>
    Beneath this cloyster wall:<br>
  See through the hawthorn blows the cold wind,<br>
    And drizzly rain doth fall.</p>

<p>  O stay me not, thou holy friar;<br>
    O stay me not, I pray;<br>
  No drizzly rain that falls on me,<br>
    Can wash my fault away.</p>

<p>  Yet stay, fair lady, turn again,<br>
    And dry those pearly tears;<br>
  For see beneath this gown of gray<br>
    Thy own true-love appears.</p>

<p>  Here forc'd by grief, and hopeless love,<br>
    These holy weeds I sought;<br>
  And here amid these lonely walls<br>
    To end my days I thought.</p>

<p>  But haply for my year of grace<br>
    Is not yet past away,<br>
  Might I still hope to win thy love,<br>
    No longer would I stay.</p>

<p>  Now farewell grief, and welcome joy<br>
    Once more unto my heart;<br>
  For since I have found thee, lovely youth,<br>
    We never more will part.</p>

  A falser steward than he was one,<br>
    Servde not in bower nor hall.</p>

<p>  He wolde have layne by our comelye queene,<br>

  Our queene she was a good wom&agrave;n,<br>
    And evermore said him naye.</p>

<p>  Sir Aldingar was wrothe in his mind,<br>
    With her hee was never content,<br>
  Till traiterous meanes he colde devyse,<br>
    In a fyer to have her brent.</p>

<p>  There came a lazar to the kings gate,<br>
    A lazar both blinde and lame:<br>
  He tooke the lazar upon his backe,<br>
    Him on the queenes bed has layne.</p>

<p>  "Lye still, lazar, whereas thou lyest,<br>
    Looke thou goe not hence away;<br>
  He make thee a whole man and a sound<br>
    In two howers of the day."</p>

<p>  Then went him forth Sir Aldingar,<br>
    And hyed him to our king:<br>
  "If I might have grace, as I have space,<br>
    Sad tydings I could bring."</p>

<p>  Say on, say on, Sir Aldingar,<br>
    Saye on the soothe to mee.<br>

  Now out alacke! said our comly queene,<br>

<p>  Now out alacke! sayd our comlye queene,<br>
    My heart with griefe will brast.<br>
  I had thought swevens had never been true;<br>
    I have proved them true at last.</p>

<p>  I dreamt in my sweven on Thursday eve,<br>
    In my bed whereas I laye.<br>
  I dreamt a grype and a grimlie beast<br>
    Had carryed my crowne awaye;</p>

<p>  My gorgett and my kirtle of golde,<br>
    And all my faire head-geere:<br>
  And he wold worrye me with his tush<br>
    And to his nest y-beare:</p>

<p>  Saving there came a little 'gray' hawke,<br>
    A merlin him they call,<br>
  Which untill the grounde did strike the grype,<br>
    That dead he downe did fall.</p>

<p>  Giffe I were a man, as now I am none,<br>
    A battell wold I prove,<br>
  To fight with that traitor Aldingar,<br>
    Att him I cast my glove.</p>

<p>  But seeing Ime able noe battell to make,<br>
    My liege, grant me a knight<br>
  To fight with that traitor Sir Aldingar,<br>
    To maintaine me in my right.</p>

<p>  "Now forty dayes I will give thee<br>
    To seeke thee a knight therein:<br>
  If thou find not a knight in forty dayes<br>
    Thy bodye it must brenn."</p>

<p>  Then shee sent east, and shee sent west,<br>
    By north and south bedeene:<br>
  But never a champion colde she find,<br>
    Wolde fight with that knight soe keene.</p>

<p>  Now twenty dayes were spent and gone,<br>
    Noe helpe there might be had;<br>
  Many a teare shed our comelye queene<br>
    And aye her hart was sad.</p>

<p>  Then came one of the queenes dams&egrave;lles,<br>
    And knelt upon her knee,<br>
  "Cheare up, cheare up, my gracious dame,<br>
    I trust yet helpe may be:</p>

<p>  And here I will make mine avowe,<br>
    And with the same me binde;<br>
  That never will I return to thee,<br>
    Till I some helpe may finde."</p>

<p>  Then forth she rode on a faire palfr&agrave;ye<br>
    Oer hill and dale about:<br>
  But never a champion colde she finde,<br>
    Wolde fighte with that knight so stout.</p>

<p>  And nowe the daye drewe on a pace,<br>
    When our good queene must dye;<br>
  All woe-begone was that faire dams&egrave;lle,<br>
    When she found no helpe was nye.</p>

<p>  All woe-begone was that faire dams&egrave;lle,<br>
    And the salt teares fell from her eye:<br>
  When lo! as she rode by a rivers side,<br>
    She met with a tinye boye.</p>

<p>  A tinye boye she mette, God wot,<br>
    All clad in mantle of golde;<br>
  He seemed noe more in mans liken&egrave;sse,<br>
    Then a childe of four yeere old.</p>

<p>  Why grieve you, damselle faire, he sayd,<br>
    And what doth cause you moane?<br>
  The damsell scant wolde deigne a looke,<br>
    But fast she pricked on.</p>

<p>  Yet turne againe, thou faire dams&egrave;lle<br>
    And greete thy queene from mee:<br>
  When bale is att hyest, boote is nyest,<br>
    Nowe helpe enoughe may bee.</p>

<p>  Bid her remember what she dreamt<br>
    In her bedd, wheras shee laye;<br>
  How when the grype and grimly beast<br>
    Wolde have carried her crowne awaye,</p>

<p>  Even then there came the little gray hawke,<br>
    And saved her from his clawes:<br>
  Then bidd the queene be merry at hart,<br>
    For heaven will fende her cause.</p>

<p>  Back then rode that faire dams&egrave;lle,<br>
    And her hart it lept for glee:<br>
  And when she told her gracious dame<br>
    A gladd woman then was shee:</p>

<p>  But when the appointed day was come,<br>
    No helpe appeared nye:<br>
  Then woeful, woeful was her hart,<br>
    And the teares stood in her eye.</p>

<p>  And nowe a fyer was built of wood;<br>
    And a stake was made of tree;<br>
  And now Queene Elinor forth was led,<br>
    A sorrowful sight to see.</p>

<p>  Three times the herault he waved his hand,<br>
    And three times spake on hye:<br>
  Giff any good knight will fende this dame,<br>
    Come forth, or shee must dye.</p>

<p>  No knight stood forth, no knight there came,<br>
    No helpe appeared nye:<br>
  And now the fyer was lighted up,<br>
    Queen Elinor she must dye.</p>

<p>  And now the fyer was lighted up,<br>
    As hot as hot might bee;<br>
  When riding upon a little white steed,<br>
    The tinye boy they see.</p>

<p>  "Away with that stake, away with those brands,<br>
    And loose our comelye queene:<br>
  I am come to fight with Sir Aldingar,<br>
    And prove him a traitor keene."</p>

<p>  Forthe then stood Sir Aldingar,<br>
    But when he saw the chylde,<br>
  He laughed, and scoffed, and turned his backe,<br>
    And weened he had been beguylde.</p>

<p>  "Now turne, now turne thee, Aldingar,<br>
    And eyther fighte or flee;<br>
  I trust that I shall avenge the wronge,<br>
    Thoughe I am so small to see."</p>

<p>  The boy pulld forth a well good sworde<br>
    So gilt it dazzled the ee;<br>
  The first stroke stricken at Aldingar,<br>
    Smote off his leggs by the knee.</p>

<p>  "Stand up, stand up, thou false trait&ograve;r,<br>
    And fight upon thy feete,<br>
  For and thou thrive, as thou begin'st,<br>
    Of height wee shall be meete."</p>

<p>  A priest, a priest, sayes Alding&agrave;r,<br>
    While I am a man alive.<br>
  A priest, a priest, sayes Alding&agrave;r,<br>
    Me for to houzle and shrive.</p>

<p>  I wolde have laine by our comlie queene,<br>
    Bot shee wolde never consent;<br>
  Then I thought to betraye her unto our kinge<br>
    In a fyer to have her brent.</p>

<p>  There came a lazar to the kings gates,<br>
    A lazar both blind and lame:<br>
  I tooke the lazar upon my backe,<br>
    And on her bedd had him layne.</p>

<p>  Then ranne I to our comlye king,<br>
    These tidings sore to tell.<br>
  But ever alacke! sayes Aldingar,<br>
    Falsing never doth well.</p>

<p>  Forgive, forgive me, queene, madame,<br>
    The short time I must live.<br>
  "Nowe Christ forgive thee, Aldingar,<br>
    As freely I forgive."</p>

<p>  Here take thy queene, our king Harry&egrave;,<br>
    And love her as thy life,<br>
  For never had a king in Christentye.<br>
    A truer and fairer wife.</p>

<p>  King Henrye ran to claspe his queene,<br>
    And loosed her full sone:<br>
  Then turned to look for the tinye boye;<br>
    --The boye was vanisht and gone.</p>

<p>  But first he had touched the lazar man,<br>
    And stroakt him with his hand:<br>
  The lazar under the gallowes tree<br>
    All whole and sounde did stand.</p>

<p>  The lazar under the gallowes tree<br>
    Was comelye, straight and tall;<br>
  King Henrye made him his head stew&agrave;rde<br>

<h2>THE BALLAD OF <a name="CHEVY CHACE">CHEVY CHACE</a></h2>
<img alt="184.jpg (108K)" src="images/184.jpg" height="435" width="773">
<br><br>


<p>  God prosper long our noble king,<br>
    Our lives and safetyes all;<br>
  A woefull hunting once there did<br>
    In Chevy-Chace befall;</p>

<p>  To drive the deere with hound and horne,<br>
    Erle Percy took his way,<br>
  The child may rue that is unborne,<br>
    The hunting of that day.</p>

<p>  The stout Erle of Northumberland<br>
    A vow to God did make,<br>
  His pleasure in the Scottish woods<br>
    Three summers days to take;</p>

<p>  The cheefest harts in Chevy-chace<br>
    To kill and beare away.<br>
  These tydings to Erle Douglas came,<br>
    In Scotland where he lay:</p>

<p>  Who sent Erle Percy present word,<br>
    He wold prevent his sport.<br>
  The English erle, not fearing that,<br>
    Did to the woods resort</p>

<p>  With fifteen hundred bow-men bold;<br>
    All chosen men of might,<br>
  Who knew full well in time of neede<br>
    To ayme their shafts arright.</p>

<p>  The galland greyhounds swiftly ran,<br>
    To chase the fallow deere:<br>
  On munday they began to hunt,<br>
    Ere day-light did appeare;</p>

<p>  And long before high noone they had<br>
    An hundred fat buckes slaine;<br>
  Then having dined, the drovyers went<br>
    To rouze the deare againe.</p>

<p>  The bow-men mustered on the hills,<br>
    Well able to endure;<br>
  Theire backsides all, with speciall care,<br>
    That day were guarded sure.</p>

<p>  The hounds ran swiftly through the woods,<br>
    The nimble deere to take,<br>
  That with their cryes the hills and dales<br>
    An eccho shrill did make.</p>

<p>  Lord Percy to the quarry went,<br>
    To view the slaughter'd deere;<br>
  Quoth he, Erle Douglas promised<br>
    This day to meet me heere:</p>

<p>  But if I thought he wold not come,<br>
    Noe longer wold I stay.<br>
  With that, a brave younge gentleman<br>
    Thus to the Erle did say:</p>

<p>  Loe, yonder doth Erle Douglas come,<br>
    His men in armour bright;<br>
  Full twenty hundred Scottish speres<br>
    All marching in our sight;</p>

<p>  All men of pleasant Tivydale,<br>
    Fast by the river Tweede:<br>
  O cease your sports, Erle Percy said,<br>
    And take your bowes with speede:</p>

<p>  And now with me, my countrymen,<br>
    Your courage forth advance;<br>
  For there was never champion yett,<br>
    In Scotland nor in France,</p>

<p>  That ever did on horsebacke come,<br>
    But if my hap it were,<br>
  I durst encounter man for man,<br>
    With him to break a spere.</p>

<p>  Erle Douglas on his milke-white steede,<br>
    Most like a baron bolde,<br>
  Rode foremost of his company,<br>
    Whose armour shone like gold.</p>

<p>  Show me, sayd hee, whose men you bee,<br>
    That hunt soe boldly heere,<br>
  That, without my consent, doe chase<br>
    And kill my fallow-deere.</p>

<p>  The first man that did answer make<br>
    Was noble Percy hee;<br>
  Who sayd, Wee list not to declare,<br>
    Nor shew whose men wee bee:<br>
  Yet wee will spend our deerest blood,<br>
    Thy cheefest harts to slay.<br>
  Then Douglas swore a solempne oathe,<br>
    And thus in rage did say,</p>

<p>  Ere thus I will out-braved bee,<br>
    One of us two shall dye:<br>
  I know thee well, an erle thou art;<br>
    Lord Percy, soe am I.</p>

<p>  But trust me, Percy, pittye it were,<br>
    And great offence to kill<br>
  Any of these our guiltlesse men,<br>
    For they have done no ill.</p>

<p>  Let thou and I the battell trye,<br>
    And set our men aside.<br>
  Accurst bee he, Erle Percy sayd,<br>
    By whome this is denyed.</p>

<p>  Then stept a gallant squier forth,<br>
    Witherington was his name,<br>
  Who said, I wold not have it told<br>
    To Henry our king for shame,</p>

<p>  That ere my captaine fought on foote,<br>
    And I stood looking on.<br>
  You be two erles, sayd Witherington,<br>
    And I a squier alone:</p>

<p>  He doe the best that doe I may,<br>
    While I have power to stand:<br>
  While I have power to weeld my sword<br>
    He fight with hart and hand.</p>

<p>  Our English archers bent their bowes,<br>
    Their harts were good and trew;<br>
  Att the first flight of arrowes sent,<br>
    Full four-score Scots they slew.</p>

<p>  Yet bides Earl Douglas on the bent,<br>
    As Chieftain stout and good.<br>
  As valiant Captain, all unmov'd<br>
    The shock he firmly stood.</p>

<p>  His host he parted had in three,<br>
    As Leader ware and try'd,<br>
  And soon his spearmen on their foes<br>
    Bare down on every side.</p>

<p>  To drive the deere with hound and horne,<br>
    Douglas bade on the bent<br>
  Two captaines moved with mickle might<br>
    Their speres to shivers went.</p>

<p>  Throughout the English archery<br>
    They dealt full many a wound:<br>
  But still our valiant Englishmen<br>
    All firmly kept their ground:</p>

<p>  And throwing strait their bows away,<br>
    They grasp'd their swords so bright:<br>
  And now sharp blows, a heavy shower,<br>
    On shields and helmets light.</p>

<p>  They closed full fast on every side,<br>
    Noe slackness there was found:<br>
  And many a gallant gentleman<br>
    Lay gasping on the ground.</p>

<p>  O Christ! it was a griefe to see;<br>
    And likewise for to heare,<br>
  The cries of men lying in their gore,<br>
    And scattered here and there.</p>

<p>  At last these two stout erles did meet,<br>
    Like captaines of great might:<br>
  Like lyons wood, they layd on lode,<br>
    And made a cruell fight:</p>

<p>  They fought untill they both did sweat,<br>
    With swords of tempered steele;<br>
  Untill the blood, like drops of rain,<br>
    They tricklin downe did feele.</p>

<p>  Yeeld thee, Lord Percy, Douglas sayd<br>
    In faith I will thee bringe,<br>
  Where thou shalt high advanced bee<br>
    By James our Scottish king:</p>

<p>  Thy ransome I will freely give,<br>
    And this report of thee,<br>
  Thou art the most couragious knight,<br>
    That ever I did see.</p>

<p>  Noe, Douglas, quoth Erle Percy then,<br>
    Thy proffer I doe scorne;<br>
  I will not yeelde to any Scott,<br>
    That ever yett was borne.</p>

<p>  With that, there came an arrow keene<br>
    Out of an English bow,<br>
  Which struck Erle Douglas to the heart,<br>
    A deepe and deadlye blow:</p>

<p>  Who never spake more words than these,<br>
    Fight on, my merry men all;<br>
  For why, my life is at an end;<br>
    Lord Percy sees my fall.</p>

<p>  Then leaving liffe, Erie Percy tooke<br>
    The dead man by the hand;<br>
  And said, Erle Douglas, for thy life<br>
    Wold I had lost my land.</p>

<p>  O Christ! my verry hart doth bleed<br>
    With sorrow for thy sake;<br>
  For sure, a more redoubted knight<br>
    Mischance cold never take.</p>

<p>  A knight amongst the Scotts there was<br>
    Which saw Erle Douglas dye,<br>
  Who streight in wrath did vow revenge<br>
    Upon the Lord Percye:</p>

<p>  Sir Hugh Mountgomery was he call'd,<br>
    Who, with a spere most bright,<br>
  Well-mounted on a gallant steed,<br>
    Ran fiercely through the fight;</p>

<p>  And past the English archers all,<br>
    Without all dread or feare;<br>
  And through Earl Percyes body then<br>
    He thrust his hatefull spere;</p>

<p>  With such a vehement force and might<br>
    He did his body gore,<br>
  The staff ran through the other side<br>
    A large cloth-yard and more.</p>

<p>  So thus did both these nobles dye,<br>
    Whose courage none could staine:<br>
  An English archer then perceiv'd<br>
    The noble erle was slaine;</p>

<p>  He had a bow bent in his hand,<br>
    Made of a trusty tree;<br>
  An arrow of a cloth-yard long<br>
    Up to the head drew hee:</p>

<p>  Against Sir Hugh Mountgomerye,<br>
    So right the shaft he sett,<br>
  The grey goose-winge that was thereon,<br>
    In his harts bloode was wette.</p>

<p>  This fight did last from breake of day,<br>
    Till setting of the sun;<br>
  For when they rang the evening-bell,<br>
    The battel scarce was done.</p>

<p>  With stout Erle Percy there was slaine<br>
    Sir John of Egerton,<br>
  Sir Robert Ratcliff, and Sir John,<br>
    Sir James that bold barr&ograve;n:</p>

<p>  And with Sir George and stout Sir James,<br>
    Both knights of good account,<br>
  Good Sir Ralph Raby there was slaine,<br>
    Whose prowesse did surmount.</p>

<p>  For Witherington needs must I wayle,<br>
    As one in doleful dumpes;<br>
  For when his leggs were smitten off,<br>
    He fought upon his stumpes.</p>

<p>  And with Erle Douglas, there was slaine<br>
    Sir Hugh Montgomerye,<br>
  Sir Charles Murray, that from the feeld<br>
    One foote wold never flee.</p>

<p>  Sir Charles Murray, of Ratcliff, too,<br>
    His sisters sonne was hee;<br>
  Sir David Lamb, so well esteem'd,<br>
    Yet saved cold not bee.</p>

<p>  And the Lord Maxwell in like case<br>
    Did with Erle Douglas dye:<br>
  Of twenty hundred Scottish speres,<br>
    Scarce fifty-five did flye.</p>

<p>  Of fifteen hundred Englishmen,<br>
    Went home but fifty-three;<br>
  The rest were slaine in Chevy-Chace,<br>
    Under the greene woode tree.</p>

<p>  Next day did many widowes come,<br>
    Their husbands to bewayle;<br>
  They washt their wounds in brinish teares,<br>
    But all wold not prevayle.</p>

<p>  Theyr bodyes, bathed in purple gore,<br>
    They bare with them away:<br>
  They kist them dead a thousand times,<br>
    Ere they were cladd in clay.</p>

<p>  The news was brought to Eddenborrow,<br>
    Where Scottlands king did raigne,<br>
  That brave Erle Douglas suddenlye<br>
    Was with an arrow slaine:</p>

<p>  O heavy newes, King James did say,<br>
    Scotland may witnesse bee,<br>
  I have not any captaine more<br>
    Of such account as hee.</p>

<p>  Like tydings to King Henry came,<br>
    Within as short a space,<br>
  That Percy of Northumberland<br>
    Was slaine in Chevy-Chace:</p>

<p>  Now God be with him, said our king,<br>
    Sith it will noe better bee;<br>
  I trust I have, within my realme,<br>
    Five hundred as good as hee:</p>

<p>  Yett shall not Scotts nor Scotland say,<br>
    But I will vengeance take:<br>
  I'll be revenged on them all,<br>
    For brave Erle Percyes sake.</p>

<p>  This vow full well the king perform'd<br>
    After, at Humbledowne;<br>
  In one day, fifty knights were slayne,<br>
    With lords of great renowne:</p>

<p>  And of the rest, of small acount,<br>
    Did many thousands dye:<br>
  Thus endeth the hunting of Chevy-Chase,<br>
    Made by the Erle Percy.</p>

<p>  God save our king, and bless this land<br>
    With plenty, joy, and peace;<br>
  And grant henceforth, that foule debate<br>
    'Twixt noblemen may cease.</p>

<p>  When Arthur first in court began,<br>
    And was approved king,<br>
   By force of armes great victorys wanne,<br>
  And conquest home did bring,</p>

<p>  Then into England straight he came<br>
    With fifty good and able<br>
  Knights, that resorted unto him,<br>
    And were of his round table:</p>

<p>  And he had justs and turnaments,<br>
    Whereto were many prest,<br>
  Wherein some knights did far excell<br>
    And eke surmount the rest.</p>

<p>  But one Sir Lancelot du Lake,<br>
    Who was approved well,<br>
  He for his deeds and feats of armes<br>
    All others did excell.</p>

<p>  When he had rested him a while,<br>
    In play, and game, and sportt,<br>
  He said he wold goe prove himselfe<br>
    In some adventurous sort.</p>

<p>  He armed rode in a forrest wide,<br>
    And met a damsell faire,<br>
  Who told him of adventures great,<br>
    Whereto he gave great eare.</p>

<p>  Such wold I find, quoth Lancelott:<br>
    For that cause came I hither.<br>
  Thou seemest, quoth shee, a knight full good,<br>
    And I will bring thee thither.</p>

<p>  Wheras a mighty knight doth dwell,<br>
    That now is of great fame:<br>
  Therefore tell me what wight thou art,<br>
    And what may be thy name.</p>

<p>  "My name is Lancelot du Lake."<br>
    Quoth she, it likes me than:<br>
  Here dwelles a knight who never was<br>

<p>  Who has in prison threescore knights<br>
    And four, that he did wound;<br>
  Knights of King Arthurs court they be,<br>
    And of his table round.</p>

<p>  She brought him to a river side,<br>
    And also to a tree,<br>
  Whereon a copper bason hung,<br>
    And many shields to see.</p>

<p>  He struck soe hard, the bason broke;<br>
    And Tarquin soon he spyed:<br>
  Who drove a horse before him fast,<br>
    Whereon a knight lay tyed.</p>

<p>  Sir knight, then sayd Sir Lancelett,<br>
    Bring me that horse-load hither,<br>
  And lay him downe, and let him rest;<br>
    Weel try our force together:</p>

<p>  For, as I understand, thou hast,<br>
    So far as thou art able,<br>
  Done great despite and shame unto<br>
    The knights of the Round Table.</p>

<p>  If thou be of the Table Round,<br>
    Quoth Tarquin speedilye,<br>
  Both thee and all thy fellowship<br>
    I utterly defye.</p>

<p>  That's over much, quoth Lancelott tho,<br>
    Defend thee by and by.<br>
  They sett their speares unto their steeds,<br>
    And eache att other flie.</p>

<p>  They coucht theire speares (their horses ran,<br>
    As though there had beene thunder),<br>
  And strucke them each immidst their shields,<br>
    Wherewith they broke in sunder.</p>

<p>  Their horsses backes brake under them,<br>
    The knights were both astound:<br>
  To avoyd their horsses they made haste<br>
    And light upon the ground.</p>

<p>  They tooke them to their shields full fast,<br>
    Their swords they drewe out than,<br>
  With mighty strokes most eagerlye<br>
    Each at the other ran.</p>

<p>  They wounded were, and bled full sore,<br>
    They both for breath did stand,<br>
  And leaning on their swords awhile,<br>
    Quoth Tarquine, Hold thy hand,</p>

<p>  And tell to me what I shall aske.<br>
    Say on, quoth Lancelot tho.<br>
  Thou art, quoth Tarquine, the best knight<br>
    That ever I did know:</p>

<p>  And like a knight, that I did hate:<br>
    Soe that thou be not hee,<br>
  I will deliver all the rest,<br>
    And eke accord with thee.</p>

<p>  That is well said, quoth Lancelott;<br>
    But sith it must be soe,<br>
  What knight is that thou hatest thus<br>
    I pray thee to me show.</p>

<p>  His name is Lancelot du Lake,<br>
    He slew my brother deere;<br>
  Him I suspect of all the rest:<br>
    I would I had him here.</p>

<p>  Thy wish thou hast, but yet unknowne,<br>
    I am Lancelot du Lake,<br>
  Now knight of Arthurs Table Round;<br>
    King Hauds son of Schuwake;</p>

<p>  They buckled them together so,<br>
    Like unto wild boares rashing;<br>
  And with their swords and shields they ran<br>
    At one another slashing:</p>

<p>  The ground besprinkled was with blood:<br>
    Tarquin began to yield;<br>
  For he gave backe for wearinesse,<br>
    And lowe did beare his shield.</p>

<p>  Gil Morice sate in gude grene wode,<br>
    He whistled and he sang:<br>
  O what mean a' the folk com&igrave;ng,<br>
    My mother tarries lang.<br>
  His hair was like the threeds of gold,<br>
    Drawne frae Minerva's loome:<br>
  His lipps like roses drapping dew,<br>
    His breath was a' perfume.</p>

<p>  His brow was like the mountain snae<br>
    Gilt by the morning beam:<br>
  His cheeks like living roses glow:<br>
    His een like azure stream.  The boy was clad in robes of
grene,<br>
    Sweete as the infant spring:<br>
  And like the mavis on the bush,<br>
    He gart the vallies ring.</p>

<p>  The baron came to the grene wode,<br>
    Wi' mickle dule and care,<br>
  And there he first spied Gill Morice<br>
    Kameing his zellow hair:<br>
  That sweetly wavd around his face,<br>
    That face beyond compare:<br>
  He sang sae sweet it might dispel<br>
    A' rage but fell despair.</p>

<p>  Nae wonder, nae wonder, Gill Mor&igrave;ce,<br>
    My lady loed thee weel,<br>
  The fairest part of my bodie<br>

<p>  Now he has drawn his trusty brand,<br>
    And slaited on the strae;<br>
  And thro' Gill Morice' fair body<br>
    He's gar cauld iron gae.<br>
  And he has tain Gill Morice's head<br>
    And set it on a speir;<br>
  The meanest man in a' his train<br>
    Has gotten that head to bear.</p>

<p>  And he has tain Gill Morice up,<br>
    Laid him across his steid,<br>
  And brocht him to his painted bowr,<br>
    And laid him on a bed.<br>
  The lady sat on castil wa',<br>
    Beheld baith dale and doun;<br>
  And there she saw Gill Morice' head<br>
    Cum trailing to the toun.</p>

<p>  Far better I loe that bluidy head,<br>

  Oft have I by thy cradle sitten,<br>
    And fondly seen thee sleip;<br>
  But now I gae about thy grave,<br>

<p>  And syne she kissd his bluidy cheik,<br>

  O better I loe my Gill Morice<br>

  Away, away, ze ill wom&agrave;n,<br>

<p>  Obraid me not, my Lord Barnard!<br>
    Obraid me not for shame!<br>
  Wi' that saim speir O pierce my heart!<br>
    And put me out o' pain.<br>
  Since nothing bot Gill Morice head<br>
    Thy jelous rage could quell,<br>
  Let that saim hand now tak hir life,<br>
    That neir to thee did ill.</p>

<p>  To me nae after days nor nichts<br>
    Will eir be saft or kind;<br>
  I'll fill the air with heavy sighs,<br>
    And greet till I am blind.<br>
  Enouch of blood by me's been spilt,<br>
    Seek not zour death frae mee;<br>
  I rather lourd it had been my sel<br>
    Than eather him or thee.</p>

<p>  With waefo wae I hear zour plaint;<br>
    Sair, sair I rew the deid,<br>
  That eir this cursed hand of mine<br>
    Had gard his body bleid.<br>
  Dry up zour tears, my winsome dame,<br>
    Ze neir can heal the wound;<br>
  Ze see his head upon the speir,<br>
    His heart's blude on the ground.</p>

<p>  I curse the hand that did the deid,<br>
    The heart that thocht the ill;<br>
  The feet that bore me wi' sik speid,<br>
    The comely zouth to kill.<br>
  I'll ay lament for Gill Morice,<br>
    As gin he were mine ain;<br>
  I'll neir forget the dreiry day<br>
    On which the zouth was slain.</p>

  A younge and comely knighte.</p>

<p>  The Child of Elle to his garden went,<br>

    With mickle dole and ire.</p>

<p>  Fair Emmeline sighed, faire Emmeline wept,<br>

<p>  In deepe revolving thought he stoode,<br>
    And mused a little space;<br>
  Then raised faire Emmeline from the grounde,<br>
    With many a fond embrace.</p>

<p>  Here take her, Child of Elle, he sayd,<br>
    And gave her lillye white hand;<br>
  Here take my deare and only child,<br>

<p>  Thy father once mine honour wrongde<br>
    In dayes of youthful pride;<br>
  Do thou the injurye repayre<br>
    In fondnesse for thy bride.</p>

    Heaven prosper thee and thine:<br>
  And nowe my blessing wend wi' thee,<br>
    My lovelye Emmeline.</p>

    That ever I saw with mine ee.</p>

<p>  But that his bellye it is soe bigg,<br>
    His girdle goes wonderous hie:<br>
  And let him, I pray you, Childe Wat&egrave;res,<br>
    Goe into the chamber with mee.</p>

<p>  It is not fit for a little foot-page,<br>
    That has run throughe mosse and myre,<br>
  To go into the chamber with any ladye,<br>
    That weares soe riche attyre.</p>

<p>  It is more meete for a litle foot-page,<br>

<p>  I pray you nowe, good Child Wat&egrave;rs,<br>
    Let mee lye at your bedds feete:<br>
  For there is noe place about this house,<br>

<p>  'He gave her leave, and faire Ell&egrave;n<br>
    'Down at his beds feet laye:'<br>
  This done the nighte drove on apace,<br>
    And when it was neare the daye,</p>

<p>  Hee sayd, Rise up, my litle foot-page,<br>
    Give my steede corne and haye;<br>
  And soe doe thou the good black oats,<br>
    To carry mee better awaye.</p>

<p>  Up then rose the faire Ell&egrave;n,<br>
    And gave his steede corne and hay:<br>
  And soe shee did the good blacke oats,<br>
    To carry him the better away.</p>

<p>  Shee leaned her backe to the manger side,<br>
    And grievouslye did groane:<br>
  Shee leaned her backe to the manger side,<br>
    And there shee made her moane.</p>

<p>  And that beheard his mother deere,<br>
    Shee heard her there monand.<br>
  Shee sayd, Rise up, thou Childe Wat&egrave;rs,<br>
    I think thee a cursed man.</p>

<p>  For in thy stable is a ghost,<br>
    That grievouslye doth grone:<br>
  Or else some woman laboures of childe,<br>
    She is soe woe-begone.</p>

<p>  Up then rose Childe Waters soon,<br>
    And did on his shirte of silke;<br>
  And then he put on his other clothes,<br>
    On his body as white as milke.</p>

<p>  And when he came to the stable dore,<br>
    Full still there he did stand,<br>
  That hee mighte heare his fayre Ell&egrave;n<br>
    Howe shee made her mon&agrave;nd.</p>

<p>  Shee sayd, Lullabye, mine owne deere child,<br>
    Lullabye, dere child, dere;<br>
  I wold thy father were a king,<br>
    Thy mother layd on a biere.</p>

<p>  Peace now, he said, good faire Ell&egrave;n,<br>

<br><br>

<p>  In summer time, when leaves grow greene,<br>
     And blossoms bedecke the tree,<br>
  King Edward wolde a hunting ryde,<br>
    Some pastime for to see.</p>

<p>  With hawke and hounde he made him bowne,<br>
    With horne, and eke with bowe;<br>
  To Drayton Basset he tooke his waye,<br>
    With all his lordes a rowe.</p>

<p>  And he had ridden ore dale and downe<br>
    By eight of clocke in the day,<br>
  When he was ware of a bold tann&egrave;r,<br>
    Come ryding along the waye.</p>

<p>  A fayre russet coat the tanner had on<br>
    Fast buttoned under his chin,<br>
  And under him a good cow-hide,<br>
    And a marc of four shilling.</p>

<p>  Nowe stand you still, my good lordes all,<br>
    Under the grene wood spraye;<br>
  And I will wend to yonder fellowe,<br>
    To weet what he will saye.</p>

<p>  God speede, God speede thee, said our king.<br>
    Thou art welcome, Sir, sayd hee.<br>
  "The readyest waye to Drayton Basset<br>
    I praye thee to shew to mee."</p>

<p>  "To Drayton Basset woldst thou goe,<br>
    Fro the place where thou dost stand?<br>
  The next payre of gallowes thou comest unto,<br>
    Turne in upon thy right hand."</p>

<p>  That is an unreadye waye, sayd our king,<br>
    Thou doest but jest, I see;<br>
  Nowe shewe me out the nearest waye,<br>
    And I pray thee wend with mee.</p>

<p>  Away with a vengeance! quoth the tanner:<br>
    I hold thee out of thy witt:<br>
  All daye have I rydden on Brocke my mare,<br>
    And I am fasting yett.</p>

<p>  "Go with me downe to Drayton Basset,<br>
    No daynties we will spare;<br>
  All daye shalt thou eate and drinke of the best,<br>
    And I will paye thy fare."</p>

<p>  Gramercye for nothing, the tanner replyde,<br>
    Thou payest no fare of mine:<br>
  I trowe I've more nobles in my purse,<br>
    Than thou hast pence in thine.</p>

<p>  God give thee joy of them, sayd the king,<br>
    And send them well to priefe.<br>
  The tanner wolde faine have beene away,<br>
    For he weende he had beene a thiefe.</p>

<p>  What art thou, hee sayde, thou fine fellowe,<br>
    Of thee I am in great feare,<br>
  For the clothes, thou wearest upon thy back,<br>
    Might beseeme a lord to weare.</p>

<p>  I never stole them, quoth our king,<br>
    I tell you, Sir, by the roode.<br>
  "Then thou playest, as many an unthrift doth,<br>
    And standest in midds of thy goode."</p>

<p>  What tydinges heare you, sayd the kynge,<br>
    As you ryde farre and neare?<br>
  "I heare no tydinges, Sir, by the masse,<br>
    But that cowe-hides are deare."</p>

<p>  "Cow-hides! cow-hides! what things are those?<br>
     I marvell what they bee?"<br>
  What, art thou a foole? the tanner reply'd;<br>
    I carry one under mee.</p>

<p>  What craftsman art thou, said the king,<br>
    I pray thee tell me trowe.<br>
  "I am a barker, Sir, by my trade;<br>
    Nowe tell me what art thou?"</p>

<p>  I am a poor courtier, Sir, quoth he,<br>
    That am forth of service worne;<br>
  And faine I wolde thy prentise bee,<br>
    Thy cunninge for to learne.</p>

<p>  Marrye heaven forfend, the tanner replyde,<br>
    That thou my prentise were:<br>
  Thou woldst spend more good than I shold winne<br>
    By fortye shilling a yere.</p>

<p>  Yet one thinge wolde I, sayd our king,<br>
    If thou wilt not seeme strange:<br>
  Thoughe my horse be better than thy mare,<br>
    Yet with thee I fain wold change.</p>

<p>  "Why if with me thou faine wilt change,<br>
    As change full well maye wee,<br>
  By the faith of my bodye, thou proude fellowe<br>
    I will have some boot of thee."</p>

<p>  That were against reason, sayd the king,<br>
    I sweare, so mote I thee:<br>
  My horse is better than thy mare,<br>
    And that thou well mayst see.</p>

<p>  "Yea, Sir, but Brocke is gentle and mild,<br>
    And softly she will fare:<br>
  Thy horse is unrulye and wild, I wiss;<br>
    Aye skipping here and theare."</p>

<p>  What boote wilt thou have? our king reply'd;<br>
    Now tell me in this stound.<br>
  "Noe pence, nor halfpence, by my faye,<br>
    But a noble in gold so round.</p>

<p>  "Here's twentye groates of white moneye,<br>
    Sith thou will have it of mee."<br>
  I would have sworne now, quoth the tanner,<br>
    Thou hadst not had one pennie.</p>

<p>  But since we two have made a change,<br>
    A change we must abide,<br>
  Although thou hast gotten Brocke my mare,<br>
    Thou gettest not my cowe-hide.</p>

<p>  I will not have it, sayd the kynge,<br>
    I sweare, so mought I thee;<br>
  Thy foule cowe-hide I wolde not beare,<br>
    If thou woldst give it to mee.</p>

<p>  The tanner hee tooke his good cowe-hide,<br>
    That of the cow was bilt;<br>
  And threwe it upon the king's sadelle,<br>
    That was soe fayrelye gilte.<br>
  "Now help me up, thou fine fellowe,<br>
    'Tis time that I were gone:<br>
  When I come home to Gyllian my wife,<br>
    Sheel say I am a gentilmon."</p>

<p>  The king he tooke him up by the legge;<br>
    The tanner a f----- lett fall.<br>
  Nowe marrye, good fellowe, sayd the king,<br>
    Thy courtesye is but small.</p>

<p>  When the tanner he was in the kinges sad&egrave;lle,<br>
    And his foote in the stirrup was;<br>
  He marvelled greatlye in his minde,<br>
    Whether it were golde or brass.</p>

<p>  But when the steede saw the cows taile wagge,<br>
    And eke the blacke cowe-horne;<br>
  He stamped, and stared, and awaye he ranne,<br>
    As the devill had him borne.</p>

<p>  The tanner he pulld, the tanner he sweat,<br>
    And held by the pummil fast:<br>
  At length the tanner came tumbling downe;<br>
    His necke he had well-nye brast.</p>

<p>  Take thy horse again with a vengeance, he sayd,<br>
    With mee he shall not byde.<br>
  "My horse wolde have borne thee well enoughe,<br>
    But he knewe not of thy cowe-hide.</p>

<p>  Yet if againe thou faine woldst change,<br>
    As change full well may wee,<br>
  By the faith of my bodye, thou jolly tann&egrave;r,<br>
    I will have some boote of thee."</p>

<p>  What boote wilt thou have? the tanner replyd,<br>
    Nowe tell me in this stounde.<br>
  "Noe pence nor halfpence, Sir, by my faye,<br>
    But I will have twentye pound."</p>

<p>  "Here's twentye groates out of my purse;<br>
    And twentye I have of thine:<br>
  And I have one more, which we will spend<br>
    Together at the wine."</p>

<p>  The king set a bugle home to his mouthe,<br>
    And blewe both loude and shrille:<br>
  And soone came lords, and soone came knights,<br>
    Fast ryding over the hille.</p>

<p>  Nowe, out alas! the tanner he cryde,<br>
    That ever I sawe this daye!<br>
  Thou art a strong thiefe, yon come thy fellowes     Will beare
my<br>
cowe-hide away.</p>

<p>  They are no thieves, the king replyde,<br>
    I sweare, soe mote I thee:<br>
  But they are the lords of the north countr&egrave;y,<br>
    Here come to hunt with mee.</p>

<p>  And soone before our king they came,<br>
    And knelt downe on the grounde:<br>
  Then might the tanner have beene awaye,<br>
    He had lever than twentye pounde.</p>

<p>  A coller, a coller, here: sayd the king,<br>
    A coller he loud gan crye:<br>
  Then woulde he lever than twentye pound,<br>
    He had not beene so nighe.</p>

<p>  A coller, a coller, the tanner he sayd,<br>
    I trowe it will breed sorrowe:<br>
  After a coller cometh a halter,<br>
    I trow I shall be hang'd to-morrowe.</p>

<p>  Be not afraid, tanner, said our king;<br>
    I tell thee, so mought I thee,<br>
  Lo here I make thee the best esquire<br>
    That is in the North countrie.</p>

<p>  For Plumpton-parke I will give thee,<br>
    With tenements faire beside:<br>
  'Tis worth three hundred markes by the yeare,<br>
    To maintaine thy good cowe-hide.</p>

<p>  Gramercye, my liege, the tanner replyde,<br>
    For the favour thou hast me showne;<br>
  If ever thou comest to merry Tamw&ograve;rth,<br>
    Neates leather shall clout thy shoen.</p>

<p>  It was intill a pleasant time,<br>
    Upon a simmer's day,<br>
  The noble Earl of Mar's daughter<br>
  Went forth to sport and play.</p>

<p>  As thus she did amuse hersell,<br>
    Below a green aik tree,<br>
  There she saw a sprightly doo<br>
    Set on a tower sae hie.</p>

<p>  "O cow-me-doo, my love sae true,<br>
    If ye'll come down to me,<br>
  Ye 'se hae a cage o guid red gowd<br>

    Nor yet these words well said,<br>
  Till Cow-me-doo flew frae the tower<br>
    And lighted on her head.</p>

<p>  Then she has brought this pretty bird<br>
    Hame to her bowers and ba,<br>
  And made him shine as fair a bird<br>
    As ony o them a'.</p>

<p>  When day was gane, and night was come,<br>
    About the evening tide,<br>
  This lady spied a sprightly youth<br>
    Stand straight up by her side.</p>

<p>  "From whence came ye, young man?" she said;<br>
    "That does surprise me sair;<br>
  My door was bolted right secure,<br>

<p>  "Likewise well skilld in magic spells,<br>

    And the seventh she's brought hame.</p>

<p>  But aye as ever a child was born<br>
    He carried them away,<br>
  And brought them to his mither's care,<br>
    As fast as he coud fly.</p>

<p>  Thus he has staid in bower wi her<br>
    For twenty years and three;<br>
  There came a lord o high renown<br>
    To court this fair ladie.</p>

<p>  But still his proffer she refused,<br>
    And a' his presents too;<br>
  Says, I'm content to live alane<br>
    Wi my bird, Cow-me-doo.</p>

<p>  Her father sware a solemn oath<br>
    Amang the nobles all,<br>
  "The morn, or ere I eat or drink,<br>

<p>  Then Cow-me-doo took flight and flew<br>
    Beyond the raging sea,<br>
  And lighted near his mither's castle,<br>
    On a tower o gowd sae hie.</p>

<p>  As his mither was wauking out,<br>
    To see what she coud see,<br>
  And there she saw her little son,<br>
    Set on the tower sae hie.</p>

<p>  "Get dancers here to dance," she said,<br>

  For here's my young son, Florentine,<br>
    Come here wi me to stay."</p>

<p>  "Get nae dancers to dance, mither,<br>

    The morn's her wedding-day."</p>

<p>  "O tell me, tell me, Florentine,<br>
    Tell me, and tell me true,<br>
  Tell me this day without a flaw,<br>
    What I will do for you."</p>

<p>  "Instead of dancers to dance, mither,<br>
    Or minstrells for to play,<br>
  Turn four-and-twenty wall-wight men<br>
    Like storks in feathers gray;</p>

<p>  Then sichin said the queen hersell,<br>

  But she applied to an auld woman,<br>
    Who had mair skill than she.</p>

    A bird o high degree.</p>

<p>  This flock o birds took flight and flew<br>
    Beyond the raging sea,<br>
  And landed near the Earl Mar's castle,<br>
    Took shelter in every tree.</p>

<p>  They were a flock o pretty birds,<br>
    Right comely to be seen;<br>
  The people viewed them wi surprise,<br>
    As they dancd on the green.</p>

<p>  These birds ascended frae the tree<br>
    And lighted on the ha,<br>
  And at the last wi force did flee<br>
    Amang the nobles a'.</p>

<p>  The storks there seized some o the men,<br>
    They coud neither fight nor flee;<br>
  The swans they bound the bride's best man<br>
    Below a green aik tree.</p>

<p>  They lighted next on maidens fair,<br>
    Then on the bride's own head,<br>
  And wi the twinkling o an ee<br>
    The bride and them were fled.</p>

<p>  There's ancient men at weddings been<br>
    For sixty years or more,<br>

    They never saw before.</p>

<p>  For naething coud the companie do.<br>
    Nor naething coud they say<br>

    That took their bride away.</p>

<img alt="253.jpg (112K)" src="images/253.jpg" height="603" width="780">
<br><br>

<p>  King Leir once ruled in this land<br>
    With princely power and peace;<br>
  And had all things with hearts content,<br>
    That might his joys increase.<br>
  Amongst those things that nature gave,<br>
    Three daughters fair had he,<br>
  So princely seeming beautiful,<br>
    As fairer could not be.</p>

<p>  So on a time it pleas'd the king<br>
    A question thus to move,<br>
  Which of his daughters to his grace<br>
    Could shew the dearest love:<br>
  For to my age you bring content,<br>
    Quoth he, then let me hear,<br>
  Which of you three in plighted troth<br>
    The kindest will appear.</p>

<p>  To whom the eldest thus began;<br>
    Dear father, mind, quoth she,<br>
  Before your face, to do you good,<br>
    My blood shall render'd be:<br>
  And for your sake my bleeding heart<br>
    Shall here be cut in twain,<br>
  Ere that I see your reverend age<br>
    The smallest grief sustain.</p>

<p>  And so will I, the second said;<br>
    Dear father, for your sake,<br>
  The worst of all extremities<br>
    I'll gently undertake:<br>
  And serve your highness night and day<br>
    With diligence and love;<br>
  That sweet content and quietness<br>
    Discomforts may remove.</p>

<p>  In doing so, you glad my soul,<br>
    The aged king reply'd;<br>
  But what sayst thou, my youngest girl,<br>
    How is thy love ally'd?<br>
  My love (quoth young Cordelia then)<br>
    Which to your grace I owe,<br>
  Shall be the duty of a child,<br>
    And that is all I'll show.</p>

<p>  And wilt thou shew no more, quoth he,<br>
    Than doth thy duty bind?<br>
  I well perceive thy love is small,<br>
    When as no more I find.<br>
  Henceforth I banish thee my court,<br>
    Thou art no child of mine;<br>
  Nor any part of this my realm<br>
    By favour shall be thine.</p>

<p>  Thy elder sisters loves are more<br>
    Then well I can demand,<br>
  To whom I equally bestow<br>
    My kingdome and my land,<br>
  My pompal state and all my goods,<br>
    That lovingly I may<br>
  With those thy sisters be maintain'd<br>
    Until my dying day.</p>

<p>  Thus flattering speeches won renown,<br>
    By these two sisters here;<br>
  The third had causeless banishment,<br>
    Yet was her love more dear:<br>
  For poor Cordelia patiently<br>
    Went wandring up and down,<br>
  Unhelp'd, unpity'd, gentle maid,<br>
    Through many an English town:</p>

<p>  Untill at last in famous France<br>
    She gentler fortunes found;<br>
  Though poor and bare, yet she was deem'd<br>
    The fairest on the ground:<br>
  Where when the king her virtues heard,<br>
    And this fair lady seen,<br>
  With full consent of all his court<br>
    He made his wife and queen.</p>

<p>  Her father king Leir this while<br>
    With his two daughters staid:<br>
  Forgetful of their promis'd loves,<br>
    Full soon the same decay'd;<br>
  And living in queen Ragan's court,<br>
    The eldest of the twain,<br>
  She took from him his chiefest means,<br>
    And most of all his train.</p>

<p>  For whereas twenty men were wont<br>
    To wait with bended knee:<br>
  She gave allowance but to ten,<br>
    And after scarce to three;<br>
  Nay, one she thought too much for him;<br>
    So took she all away,<br>
  In hope that in her court, good king,<br>
    He would no longer stay.</p>

<p>  Am I rewarded thus, quoth he,<br>
    In giving all I have<br>
  Unto my children, and to beg<br>
    For what I lately gave?<br>
  I'll go unto my Gonorell:<br>
    My second child, I know,<br>
  Will be more kind and pitiful,<br>
    And will relieve my woe.</p>

<p>  Full fast he hies then to her court;<br>
    Where when she heard his moan<br>
  Return'd him answer, That she griev'd<br>
    That all his means were gone:<br>
  But no way could relieve his wants;<br>
    Yet if that he would stay<br>
  Within her kitchen, he should have<br>
    What scullions gave away.</p>

<p>  When he had heard, with bitter tears,<br>
    He made his answer then;<br>
  In what I did let me be made<br>
    Example to all men.<br>
  I will return again, quoth he,<br>
    Unto my Ragan's court;<br>
  She will not use me thus, I hope,<br>
    But in a kinder sort.</p>

<p>  Where when he came, she gave command<br>
    To drive him thence away:<br>
  When he was well within her court<br>
    (She said) he would not stay.<br>
  Then back again to Gonorell<br>
    The woeful king did hie,<br>
  That in her kitchen he might have<br>
    What scullion boy set by.</p>

<p>  But there of that he was deny'd,<br>
    Which she had promis'd late:<br>
  For once refusing, he should not<br>
    Come after to her gate.<br>
  Thus twixt his daughters, for relief<br>
    He wandred up and down;<br>
  Being glad to feed on beggars food,<br>
    That lately wore a crown.</p>

<p>  And calling to remembrance then<br>
    His youngest daughters words,<br>
  That said the duty of a child<br>
    Was all that love affords:<br>
  But doubting to repair to her,<br>
    Whom he had banish'd so,<br>
  Grew frantick mad; for in his mind<br>
    He bore the wounds of woe:</p>

<p>  Which made him rend his milk-white locks,<br>
    And tresses from his head,<br>
  And all with blood bestain his cheeks,<br>
    With age and honour spread.<br>
  To hills and woods and watry founts<br>
    He made his hourly moan,<br>
  Till hills and woods and sensless things,<br>
    Did seem to sigh and groan.</p>

<p>  Even thus possest with discontents,<br>
    He passed o're to France,<br>
  In hopes from fair Cordelia there,<br>
    To find some gentler chance;<br>
  Most virtuous dame! which when she heard,<br>
    Of this her father's grief,<br>
  As duty bound, she quickly sent<br>
    Him comfort and relief:<br>
  And by a train of noble peers,<br>
    In brave and gallant sort,<br>
  She gave in charge he should be brought<br>
    To Aganippus' court;<br>
  Whose royal king, with noble mind<br>
    So freely gave consent,<br>
  To muster up his knights at arms,<br>
    To fame and courage bent.</p>

<p>  And so to England came with speed,<br>
    To repossesse king Leir<br>
  And drive his daughters from their thrones<br>
    By his Cordelia dear.<br>
  Where she, true-hearted noble queen,<br>
    Was in the battel slain;<br>
  Yet he, good king, in his old days,<br>
    Possest his crown again.</p>

<p>  But when he heard Cordelia's death,<br>
    Who died indeed for love<br>
  Of her dear father, in whose cause<br>
    She did this battle move;<br>
  He swooning fell upon her breast,<br>
    From whence he never parted:<br>
  But on her bosom left his life,<br>
    That was so truly hearted.</p>

<p>  The lords and nobles when they saw<br>
    The end of these events,<br>
  The other sisters unto death<br>
    They doomed by consents;<br>
  And being dead, their crowns they left<br>
    Unto the next of kin:<br>
  Thus have you seen the fall of pride,<br>
    And disobedient sin.</p>

<br><br>

<p>I.</p>

<p>  He did not wear his scarlet coat,<br>
    For blood and wine are red,<br>
  And blood and wine were on his hands<br>
    When they found him with the dead,<br>
  The poor dead woman whom he loved,<br>
    And murdered in her bed.</p>

<p>  He walked amongst the Trial Men<br>
    In a suit of shabby grey;<br>
  A cricket cap was on his head,<br>
    And his step seemed light and gay;<br>
  But I never saw a man who looked<br>
    So wistfully at the day.</p>

<p>  I never saw a man who looked<br>
    With such a wistful eye<br>
  Upon that little tent of blue<br>
    Which prisoners call the sky,<br>
  And at every drifting cloud that went<br>
    With sails of silver by.</p>

<p>  I walked, with other souls in pain,<br>
    Within another ring,<br>
  And was wondering if the man had done<br>
    A great or little thing,<br>
  When a voice behind me whispered low,<br>
    <i>"That fellow's got to swing."</i></p>

<p>  Dear Christ! the very prison walls<br>
    Suddenly seemed to reel,<br>
  And the sky above my head became<br>
    Like a casque of scorching steel;<br>
  And, though I was a soul in pain,<br>
    My pain I could not feel.</p>

<p>  I only knew what hunted thought<br>
    Quickened his step, and why<br>
  He looked upon the garish day<br>
    With such a wistful eye;<br>
  The man had killed the thing he loved,<br>
    And so he had to die.</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  Yet each man kills the thing he loves,<br>
    By each let this be heard,<br>
  Some do it with a bitter look,<br>
    Some with a flattering word.<br>
  The coward does it with a kiss,<br>
    The brave man with a sword!</p>

<p>  Some kill their love when they are young,<br>
    And some when they are old;<br>
  Some strangle with the hands of Lust,<br>
    Some with the hands of Gold:<br>
  The kindest use a knife, because<br>
    The dead so soon grow cold.</p>

<p>  Some love too little, some too long,<br>
    Some sell, and others buy;<br>
  Some do the deed with many tears,<br>
    And some without a sigh:<br>
  For each man kills the thing he loves,<br>
    Yet each man does not die.</p>

<p>  He does not die a death of shame<br>
    On a day of dark disgrace,<br>
  Nor have a noose about his neck,<br>
    Nor a cloth upon his face,<br>
  Nor drop feet foremost through the floor<br>
    Into an empty space.</p>

<p>  He does not sit with silent men<br>
    Who watch him night and day;<br>
  Who watch him when he tries to weep,<br>
    And when he tries to pray;<br>
  Who watch him lest himself should rob<br>
    The prison of its prey.</p>

<p>  He does not wake at dawn to see<br>
    Dread figures throng his room,<br>
  The shivering Chaplain robed in white,<br>
    The Sheriff stern with gloom,<br>
  And the Governor all in shiny black,<br>
    With the yellow face of Doom.</p>

<p>  He does not rise in piteous haste<br>
    To put on convict-clothes,<br>
  While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes<br>
    Each new and nerve-twitched pose,<br>
  Fingering a watch whose little ticks<br>
    Are like horrible hammer-blows.</p>

<p>  He does not feel that sickening thirst<br>
    That sands one's throat, before<br>
  The hangman with his gardener's gloves<br>
    Comes through the padded door,<br>
  And binds one with three leathern thongs,<br>
    That the throat may thirst no more.</p>

<p>  He does not bend his head to hear<br>
    The Burial Office read,<br>
  Nor, while the anguish of his soul<br>
    Tells him he is not dead,<br>
  Cross his own coffin, as he moves<br>
    Into the hideous shed.</p>

<p>  He does not stare upon the air<br>
    Through a little roof of glass:<br>
  He does not pray with lips of clay<br>
    For his agony to pass;<br>
  Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek<br>
    The kiss of Caiaphas.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>  Six weeks the guardsman walked the yard<br>
    In the suit of shabby grey:<br>
  His cricket cap was on his head,<br>
    And his step seemed light and gay,<br>
  But I never saw a man who looked<br>
    So wistfully at the day.</p>

<p>  I never saw a man who looked<br>
    With such a wistful eye<br>
  Upon that little tent of blue<br>
    Which prisoners call the sky,<br>
  And at every wandering cloud that trailed<br>
    Its ravelled fleeces by.</p>

<p>  He did not wring his hands, as do<br>
    Those witless men who dare<br>
  To try to rear the changeling<br>
    In the cave of black Despair:<br>
  He only looked upon the sun,<br>
    And drank the morning air.</p>

<p>  He did not wring his hands nor weep,<br>
    Nor did he peek or pine,<br>
  But he drank the air as though it held<br>
    Some healthful anodyne;<br>
  With open mouth he drank the sun<br>
    As though it had been wine!</p>

<p>  And I and all the souls in pain,<br>
    Who tramped the other ring,<br>
  Forgot if we ourselves had done<br>
    A great or little thing,<br>
  And watched with gaze of dull amaze<br>
    The man who had to swing.</p>

<p>  For strange it was to see him pass<br>
    With a step so light and gay,<br>
  And strange it was to see him look<br>
    So wistfully at the day,<br>
  And strange it was to think that he<br>
    Had such a debt to pay.</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  For oak and elm have pleasant leaves<br>
    That in the spring-time shoot:<br>
  But grim to see is the gallows-tree,<br>
    With its adder-bitten root,<br>
  And, green or dry, a man must die<br>
    Before it bears its fruit!</p>

<p>  The loftiest place is that seat of grace<br>
    For which all worldlings try:<br>
  But who would stand in hempen band<br>
    Upon a scaffold high,<br>
  And through a murderer's collar take<br>
    His last look at the sky?</p>

<p>  It is sweet to dance to violins<br>
    When Love and Life are fair:<br>
  To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes<br>
    Is delicate and rare:<br>
  But it is not sweet with nimble feet<br>
    To dance upon the air!</p>

<p>  So with curious eyes and sick surmise<br>
    We watched him day by day,<br>
  And wondered if each one of us<br>
    Would end the self-same way,<br>
  For none can tell to what red Hell<br>
    His sightless soul may stray.</p>

<p>  At last the dead man walked no more<br>
    Amongst the Trial Men,<br>
  And I knew that he was standing up<br>
    In the black dock's dreadful pen,<br>
  And that never would I see his face<br>
    For weal or woe again.</p>

<p>  Like two doomed ships that pass in storm<br>
    We had crossed each other's way:<br>
  But we made no sign, we said no word,<br>
    We had no word to say;<br>
  For we did not meet in the holy night,<br>
    But in the shameful day.</p>

<p>  A prison wall was round us both,<br>
    Two outcast men we were:<br>
  The world had thrust us from its heart,<br>
    And God from out His care:<br>
  And the iron gin that waits for Sin<br>
    Had caught us in its snare.</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p>  In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,<br>
    And the dripping wall is high,<br>
  So it was there he took the air<br>
    Beneath the leaden sky,<br>
  And by each side a Warder walked,<br>
    For fear the man might die.</p>

<p>  Or else he sat with those who watched<br>
    His anguish night and day;<br>
  Who watched him when he rose to weep,<br>
    And when he crouched to pray;<br>
  Who watched him lest himself should rob<br>
    Their scaffold of its prey.</p>

<p>  The Governor was strong upon<br>
    The Regulations Act:<br>
  The Doctor said that Death was but<br>
    A scientific fact:<br>
  And twice a day the Chaplain called,<br>
    And left a little tract.</p>

<p>  And twice a day he smoked his pipe,<br>
    And drank his quart of beer:<br>
  His soul was resolute, and held<br>
    No hiding-place for fear;<br>
  He often said that he was glad<br>
    The hangman's day was near.</p>

<p>  But why he said so strange a thing<br>
    No warder dared to ask:<br>
  For he to whom a watcher's doom<br>
    Is given as his task,<br>
  Must set a lock upon his lips<br>
    And make his face a mask.</p>

<p>  Or else he might be moved, and try<br>
    To comfort or console:<br>
  And what should Human Pity do<br>
    Pent up in Murderer's Hole?<br>
  What word of grace in such a place<br>
    Could help a brother's soul?</p>

<p>  With slouch and swing around the ring<br>
    We trod the Fools' Parade!<br>
  We did not care: we knew we were<br>
    The Devil's Own Brigade:<br>
  And shaven head and feet of lead<br>
    Make a merry masquerade.</p>

<p>  We tore the tarry rope to shreds<br>
    With blunt and bleeding nails;<br>
  We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,<br>
    And cleaned the shining rails:<br>
  And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,<br>
    And clattered with the pails.</p>

<p>  We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,<br>
    We turned the dusty drill:<br>
  We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,<br>
    And sweated on the mill:<br>
  But in the heart of every man<br>
    Terror was lying still.</p>

<p>  So still it lay that every day<br>
    Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:<br>
  And we forgot the bitter lot<br>
    That waits for fool and knave,<br>
  Till once, as we tramped in from work,<br>
    We passed an open grave.</p>

<p>  With yawning mouth the yellow hole<br>
    Gaped for a living thing;<br>
  The very mud cried out for blood<br>
    To the thirsty asphalte ring:<br>
  And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair<br>
    Some prisoner had to swing.</p>

<p>  Right in we went, with soul intent<br>
    On Death and Dread and Doom:<br>
  The hangman, with his little bag,<br>
    Went shuffling through the gloom:<br>
  And I trembled as I groped my way<br>
    Into my numbered tomb.</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  That night the empty corridors<br>
    Were full of forms of Fear,<br>
  And up and down the iron town<br>
    Stole feet we could not hear,<br>
  And through the bars that hide the stars<br>
    White faces seemed to peer.</p>

<p>  He lay as one who lies and dreams<br>
    In a pleasant meadow-land,<br>
  The watchers watched him as he slept,<br>
    And could not understand<br>
  How one could sleep so sweet a sleep<br>
    With a hangman close at hand.</p>

<p>  But there is no sleep when men must weep<br>
    Who never yet have wept:<br>
  So we--the fool, the fraud, the knave--<br>
    That endless vigil kept,<br>
  And through each brain on hands of pain<br>
    Another's terror crept.</p>

<p>  Alas! it is a fearful thing<br>
    To feel another's guilt!<br>
  For, right, within, the Sword of Sin<br>
    Pierced to its poisoned hilt,<br>
  And as molten lead were the tears we shed<br>
    For the blood we had not spilt.</p>

<p>  The warders with their shoes of felt<br>
    Crept by each padlocked door,<br>
  And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,<br>
    Grey figures on the floor,<br>
  And wondered why men knelt to pray<br>
    Who never prayed before.</p>

<p>  All through the night we knelt and prayed,<br>
    Mad mourners of a corse!<br>
  The troubled plumes of midnight shook<br>
    The plumes upon a hearse:<br>
  And bitter wine upon a sponge<br>
    Was the savour of Remorse.</p>

<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  The grey cock crew, the red cock crew,<br>
    But never came the day:<br>
  And crooked shapes of Terror crouched,<br>
    In the corners where we lay:<br>
  And each evil sprite that walks by night<br>
    Before us seemed to play.</p>

<p>  They glided past, they glided fast,<br>
    Like travellers through a mist:<br>
  They mocked the moon in a rigadoon<br>
    Of delicate turn and twist,<br>
  And with formal pace and loathsome grace<br>
    The phantoms kept their tryst.</p>

<p>  With mop and mow, we saw them go,<br>
    Slim shadows hand in hand:<br>
  About, about, in ghostly rout<br>
    They trod a saraband:<br>
  And the damned grotesques made arabesques,<br>
    Like the wind upon the sand!</p>

<p>  With the pirouettes of marionettes,<br>
    They tripped on pointed tread:<br>
  But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,<br>
    As their grisly masque they led,<br>
  And loud they sang, and long they sang,<br>
    For they sang to wake the dead.</p>

<p>  <i>"Oho!" they cried, "The world is wide,<br>
    But fettered limbs go lame!<br>
  And once, or twice, to throw the dice<br>
    Is a gentlemanly game,<br>
  But he does not win who plays with Sin<br>
    In the secret House of Shame."</i></p>

<p>  No things of air these antics were,<br>
    That frolicked with such glee:<br>
  To men whose lives were held in gyves,<br>
    And whose feet might not go free,<br>
  Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,<br>
    Most terrible to see.</p>

<p>  Around, around, they waltzed and wound;<br>
    Some wheeled in smirking pairs;<br>
  With the mincing step of a demirep<br>
    Some sidled up the stairs:<br>
  And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,<br>
    Each helped us at our prayers.</p>

<p>  The morning wind began to moan,<br>
    But still the night went on:<br>
  Through its giant loom the web of gloom<br>
    Crept till each thread was spun:<br>
  And, as we prayed, we grew afraid<br>
    Of the Justice of the Sun.</p>

<p>  The moaning wind went wandering round<br>
    The weeping prison-wall:<br>
  Till like a wheel of turning steel<br>
    We felt the minutes crawl:<br>
  O moaning wind! what had we done<br>
    To have such a seneschal?</p>

<p>  At last I saw the shadowed bars,<br>
    Like a lattice wrought in lead,<br>
  Move right across the whitewashed wall<br>
    That faced my three-plank bed,<br>
  And I knew that somewhere in the world<br>
    God's dreadful dawn was red.</p>

<p>  At six o'clock we cleaned our cells,<br>
    At seven all was still,<br>
  But the sough and swing of a mighty wing<br>
    The prison seemed to fill,<br>
  For the Lord of Death with icy breath<br>
    Had entered in to kill.</p>

<p>  He did not pass in purple pomp,<br>
    Nor ride a moon-white steed.<br>
  Three yards of cord and a sliding board<br>
    Are all the gallows' need:<br>
  So with rope of shame the Herald came<br>
    To do the secret deed.</p>

<p>  We were as men who through a fen<br>
    Of filthy darkness grope:<br>
  We did not dare to breathe a prayer,<br>
    Or to give our anguish scope:<br>
  Something was dead in each of us,<br>
    And what was dead was Hope.</p>

<p>  For Man's grim Justice goes its way,<br>
    And will not swerve aside:<br>
  It slays the weak, it slays the strong,<br>
    It has a deadly stride:<br>
  With iron heel it slays the strong,<br>
    The monstrous parricide!</p>

<p>  We waited for the stroke of eight:<br>
    Each tongue was thick with thirst:<br>
  For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate<br>
    That makes a man accursed,<br>
  And Fate will use a running noose<br>
    For the best man and the worst.</p>

<p>  We had no other thing to do,<br>
    Save to wait for the sign to come:<br>
  So, like things of stone in a valley lone,<br>
    Quiet we sat and dumb:<br>
  But each man's heart beat thick and quick,<br>
    Like a madman on a drum!</p>

<p>  With sudden shock the prison-clock<br>
    Smote on the shivering air,<br>
  And from all the gaol rose up a wail<br>
    Of impotent despair,<br>
  Like the sound that frightened marches hear<br>
    From some leper in his lair.</p>

<p>  And as one sees most fearful things<br>
    In the crystal of a dream,<br>
  We saw the greasy hempen rope<br>
    Hooked to the blackened beam,<br>
  And heard the prayer the hangman's snare<br>
    Strangled into a scream.</p>

<p>  And all the woe that moved him so<br>
    That he gave that bitter cry,<br>
  And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,<br>
    None knew so well as I:<br>
  For he who lives more lives than one<br>
    More deaths than one must die.</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>  There is no chapel on the day<br>
    On which they hang a man:<br>
  The Chaplain's heart is far too sick,<br>
    Or his face is far too wan,<br>
  Or there is that written in his eyes<br>
    Which none should look upon.</p>

<p>  So they kept us close till nigh on noon,<br>
    And then they rang the bell,<br>
  And the warders with their jingling keys<br>
    Opened each listening cell,<br>
  And down the iron stair we tramped,<br>
    Each from his separate Hell.</p>

<p>  Out into God's sweet air we went,<br>
    But not in wonted way,<br>
  For this man's face was white with fear,<br>
    And that man's face was grey,<br>
  And I never saw sad men who looked<br>
    So wistfully at the day.</p>

<p>  I never saw sad men who looked<br>
    With such a wistful eye<br>
  Upon that little tent of blue<br>
    We prisoners called the sky,<br>
  And at every happy cloud that passed<br>
    In such strange freedom by.</p>

<p>  But there were those amongst us all<br>
    Who walked with downcast head,<br>
  And knew that, had each got his due,<br>
    They should have died instead:<br>
  He had but killed a thing that lived,<br>
    Whilst they had killed the dead.</p>

<p>  For he who sins a second time<br>
    Wakes a dead soul to pain,<br>
  And draws it from its spotted shroud,<br>
    And makes it bleed again,<br>
  And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,<br>
    And makes it bleed in vain!</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb<br>
    With crooked arrows starred,<br>
  Silently we went round and round<br>
    The slippery asphalte yard;<br>
  Silently we went round and round,<br>
    And no man spoke a word.</p>

<p>  Silently we went round and round,<br>
    And through each hollow mind<br>
  The Memory of dreadful things<br>
    Rushed like a dreadful wind,<br>
  And Horror stalked before each man,<br>
    And Terror crept behind.</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  The warders strutted up and down,<br>
    And watched their herd of brutes,<br>
  Their uniforms were spick and span,<br>
    And they wore their Sunday suits,<br>
  But we knew the work they had been at,<br>
    By the quicklime on their boots.</p>

<p>  For where a grave had opened wide,<br>
    There was no grave at all:<br>
  Only a stretch of mud and sand<br>
    By the hideous prison-wall,<br>
  And a little heap of burning lime,<br>
    That the man should have his pall.</p>

<p>  For he has a pall, this wretched man,<br>
    Such as few men can claim:<br>
  Deep down below a prison-yard,<br>
    Naked for greater shame,<br>
  He lies, with fetters on each foot,<br>
    Wrapt in a sheet of flame!</p>

<p>  And all the while the burning lime<br>
    Eats flesh and bone away,<br>
  It eats the brittle bone by night,<br>
    And the soft flesh by day,<br>
  It eats the flesh and bone by turns,<br>
    But it eats the heart alway.</p>

<p>       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  For three long years they will not sow<br>
    Or root or seedling there:<br>
  For three long years the unblessed spot<br>
    Will sterile be and bare,<br>
  And look upon the wondering sky<br>
    With unreproachful stare.</p>

<p>  They think a murderer's heart would taint<br>
    Each simple seed they sow.<br>
  It is not true! God's kindly earth<br>
    Is kindlier than men know,<br>
  And the red rose would but blow more red,<br>
    The white rose whiter blow.</p>

<p>  Out of his mouth a red, red rose!<br>
    Out of his heart a white!<br>
  For who can say by what strange way,<br>
    Christ brings His will to light,<br>
  Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore<br>
    Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?</p>

<p>  But neither milk-white rose nor red<br>
    May bloom in prison-air;<br>
  The shard, the pebble, and the flint,<br>
    Are what they give us there:<br>
  For flowers have been known to heal<br>
    A common man's despair.</p>

<p>  So never will wine-red rose or white,<br>
    Petal by petal, fall<br>
  On that stretch of mud and sand that lies<br>
    By the hideous prison-wall,<br>
  To tell the men who tramp the yard<br>
    That God's Son died for all.</p>

<p>  Yet though the hideous prison-wall<br>
    Still hems him round and round,<br>
  And a spirit may not walk by night<br>
    That is with fetters bound,<br>
  And a spirit may but weep that lies<br>
    In such unholy ground.</p>

<p>  He is at peace-this wretched man--<br>
    At peace, or will be soon:<br>
  There is no thing to make him mad,<br>
    Nor does Terror walk at noon,<br>
  For the lampless Earth in which he lies<br>
    Has neither Sun nor Moon.</p>

<p>  They hanged him as a beast is hanged:<br>
    They did not even toll<br>
  A requiem that might have brought<br>
    Rest to his startled soul,<br>
  But hurriedly they took him out,<br>
    And hid him in a hole.</p>

<p>  The warders stripped him of his clothes,<br>
    And gave him to the flies:<br>
  They mocked the swollen purple throat,<br>
    And the stark and staring eyes:<br>
  And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud<br>
    In which the convict lies.</p>

<p>  The Chaplain would not kneel to pray<br>
    By his dishonoured grave:<br>
  Nor mark it with that blessed Cross<br>
    That Christ for sinners gave,<br>
  Because the man was one of those<br>
    Whom Christ came down to save.</p>

<p>  Yet all is well; he has but passed<br>
    To Life's appointed bourne:<br>
  And alien tears will fill for him<br>
    Pity's long-broken urn,<br>
  For his mourners will be outcast men,<br>
    And outcasts always mourn.</p>

<p>V</p>

<p>  I know not whether Laws be right,<br>
    Or whether Laws be wrong;<br>
  All that we know who lie in gaol<br>
    Is that the wall is strong;<br>
  And that each day is like a year,<br>
    A year whose days are long.</p>

<p>  But this I know, that every Law<br>
    That men have made for Man,<br>
  Since first Man took his brother's life,<br>
    And the sad world began,<br>
  But straws the wheat and saves the chaff<br>
    With a most evil fan.</p>

<p>  This too I know--and wise it were<br>
    If each could know the same--<br>
  That every prison that men build<br>
    Is built with bricks of shame,<br>
  And bound with bars lest Christ should see<br>
    How men their brothers maim.</p>

<p>  With bars they blur the gracious moon,<br>
    And blind the goodly sun:<br>
  And they do well to hide their Hell,<br>
    For in it things are done<br>
  That Son of God nor son of Man<br>
    Ever should look upon!</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  The vilest deeds like poison weeds,<br>
    Bloom well in prison-air;<br>
  It is only what is good in Man<br>
    That wastes and withers there:<br>
  Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,<br>
    And the Warder is Despair.</p>

<p>  For they starve the little frightened child<br>
    Till it weeps both night and day:<br>
  And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,<br>
    And gibe the old and grey,<br>
  And some grow mad, and all grow bad,<br>
    And none a word may say.</p>

<p>  Each narrow cell in which we dwell<br>
    Is a foul and dark latrine,<br>
  And the fetid breath of living Death<br>
    Chokes up each grated screen,<br>
  And all, but Lust, is turned to dust<br>
    In humanity's machine.</p>

<p>  The brackish water that we drink<br>
   Creeps with a loathsome slime,<br>
  And the bitter bread they weigh in scales<br>
   Is full of chalk and lime,<br>
  And Sleep will not lie down, but walks<br>
   Wild-eyed, and cries to Time.</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  But though lean Hunger and green Thirst<br>
   Like asp with adder fight,<br>
  We have little care of prison fare,<br>
   For what chills and kills outright<br>
  Is that every stone one lifts by day<br>
   Becomes one's heart by night.</p>

<p>  With midnight always in one's heart,<br>
   And twilight in one's cell,<br>
  We turn the crank, or tear the rope,<br>
   Each in his separate Hell,<br>
  And the silence is more awful far<br>
   Than the sound of a brazen bell.</p>

<p>  And never a human voice comes near<br>
   To speak a gentle word:<br>
  And the eye that watches through the door<br>
   Is pitiless and hard:<br>
  And by all forgot, we rot and rot,<br>
   With soul and body marred.</p>

<p>  And thus we rust Life's iron chain<br>
   Degraded and alone:<br>
  And some men curse and some men weep,<br>
    And some men make no moan:<br>
  But God's eternal Laws are kind<br>
    And break the heart of stone.</p>

<p>  And every human heart that breaks,<br>
    In prison-cell or yard,<br>
  Is as that broken box that gave<br>
    Its treasure to the Lord,<br>
  And filled the unclean leper's house<br>
    With the scent of costliest nard.</p>

<p>  Ah! happy they whose hearts can break<br>
    And peace of pardon win!<br>
  How else man may make straight his plan<br>
    And cleanse his soul from Sin?<br>
  How else but through a broken heart<br>
    May Lord Christ enter in?</p>

<p>         *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  And he of the swollen purple throat,<br>
    And the stark and staring eyes,<br>
  Waits for the holy hands that took<br>
    The Thief to Paradise;<br>
  And a broken and a contrite heart<br>
    The Lord will not despise.</p>

<p>  The man in red who reads the Law<br>
    Gave him three weeks of life,<br>
  Three little weeks in which to heal    His soul of his soul's
strife,<br>
  And cleanse from every blot of blood<br>
    The hand that held the knife.</p>

<p>  And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,<br>
    The hand that held the steel:<br>
  For only blood can wipe out blood,<br>
    And only tears can heal:<br>
  And the crimson stain that was of Cain<br>
    Became Christ's snow-white seal.</p>

<p>VI</p>

<p>  In Reading gaol by Reading town<br>
    There is a pit of shame,<br>
  And in it lies a wretched man<br>
    Eaten by teeth of flame,<br>
  In a burning winding-sheet he lies,<br>
    And his grave has got no name.</p>

<p>  And there, till Christ call forth the dead,<br>
    In silence let him lie:<br>
  No need to waste the foolish tear,<br>
    Or heave the windy sigh:<br>
  The man had killed the thing he loved,<br>
    And so he had to die.</p>

<p>  And all men kill the thing they love,<br>
    By all let this be heard,<br>
  Some do it with a bitter look,<br>
    Some with a flattering word,<br>
  The coward does it with a kiss,<br>
    The brave man with a sword!</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
